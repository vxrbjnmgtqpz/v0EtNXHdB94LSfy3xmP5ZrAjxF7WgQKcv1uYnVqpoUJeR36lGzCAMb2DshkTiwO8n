## üåä Waveform Physics

### Sound as Mechanical Waves

Sound is fundamentally a mechanical wave ‚Äì vibrations traveling through a medium (air, water, solids) as oscillations of pressure. These pressure waves have key properties:

- **Amplitude**: Height of the wave (pressure variation) corresponding to loudness
- **Frequency**: Number of wave cycles per second (Hz) determining pitch
  - 20 Hz = very low bass
  - 5 kHz = high-pitched tone
  - Human range: ~20 Hz to 20 kHz

### Complex Waveforms & Harmonics

Most real-world sounds are complex waveforms, not pure tones. **Fourier's theorem** states any complex waveform can be decomposed into a series of sine waves at various frequencies and amplitudes.

**Harmonics and overtones** shape a sound's character (timbre):

- Fundamental frequency (e.g., 440 Hz for middle A)
- Integer multiples create harmonics (880 Hz, 1320 Hz, etc.)
- Different harmonic content = different timbres (piano vs guitar playing same note)

### Digital Representation

Digital audio is essentially sampled versions of these pressure waves, requiring:

- Sufficient sample rate (Nyquist: 2√ó highest frequency)
- Adequate bit depth for amplitude resolution
- Preservation of harmonic relationships

## üìä Digital Audio Quality Metrics

### Sample Rate

**Definition**: Number of samples per second (Hz) for digitizing audio

**Nyquist-Shannon Theorem**: Sample rate must be ‚â• 2√ó highest frequency to avoid aliasing

- 44.1 kHz (CD): reproduces up to ~22 kHz (full human range)
- 48 kHz: Studio standard
- 96 kHz: Archival/professional
- **192 kHz**: JELLIE standard - extreme oversampling for prediction headroom

**Benefits of higher sample rates**:

- Better time resolution for transients
- Improved processing accuracy (filtering, alignment)
- Reduced aliasing in reconstruction algorithms

### Bit Depth (Word Length)

**Definition**: Number of bits per audio sample determining amplitude resolution

**Dynamic Range Relationship**: Each bit ‚âà 6 dB dynamic range

- 16-bit: ~96 dB dynamic range (CD quality)
- **24-bit**: ~144 dB dynamic range (JELLIE/JDAT standard)
- 32-bit float: Unnecessary for human perception

**Quantization Noise**: Lower bit depth = coarser amplitude steps = more noise floor

### Dynamic Range & SNR

**Dynamic Range**: Difference (dB) between loudest undistorted signal and noise floor
**Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Reference signal level vs noise level

**Human Perception**: ~120 dB range from hearing threshold to pain threshold
**Best human ears**: ~116 dB discernible dynamic range in ideal conditions

**PNBTR Target**: Preserve full dynamic range without compression artifacts

### Frequency Response

**Definition**: How uniformly a system reproduces different frequencies

**Ideal Response**: Flat across audible spectrum (20 Hz - 20 kHz)
**Measurement**: Amplitude (dB) vs frequency plot
**Tolerance**: ¬±1-3 dB considered "accurate" (1-2 dB typically inaudible)

**PNBTR Requirement**: Maintain frequency response retention - output spectrum matches input spectrum

### Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise (THD+N)

**Measurement Process**:

1. Input pure tone (typically 1 kHz)
2. Filter out fundamental from output
3. Measure remaining harmonics + noise
4. Express as percentage of signal or dB

**Quality Targets**:

- Consumer: <0.1% THD+N
- Professional: <0.001% THD+N
- **PNBTR Target**: Introduce no measurable distortion

**SINAD**: Signal to Noise And Distortion (THD+N in dB)

- > 116 dB SINAD = effectively inaudible distortion

## üîç Spectral Analysis

### Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

**Purpose**: Convert time-domain signal to frequency domain
**Reveals**:

- Frequency content amplitude spectrum
- Harmonic distortion components
- Noise floor characteristics
- Spurious tones

**PNBTR Application**:

- Verify spectral accuracy of reconstructions
- Detect unwanted harmonics or artifacts
- Compare input/output frequency content

### Spectrograms

**Function**: FFT over sliding time windows
**Shows**: How frequency content evolves over time
**Use Cases**: Transient analysis, musical note tracking, speech recognition

## üé® Video Signal Processing (JVID)

### Color Fidelity Metrics

**Color Gamut Coverage**: Percentage of standard color space reproducible

- sRGB: Standard web/display colors
- DCI-P3: Cinema standard
- Rec.2020: 4K HDR standard

**Delta E (ŒîE)**: Human-perceptible color difference

- ŒîE < 1: Nearly indistinguishable
- ŒîE < 3: "Color accurate" (barely noticeable)
- **PNBTR Target**: Minimal color error in JVID reconstruction

### Video as Signal

**JVID Approach**: Treat video frames as PCM-style chunks

- Linearize pixel data (RGB/YUV values)
- Stream as continuous signal like audio
- Apply same reconstruction principles as audio

## üåê Network Considerations

### Latency & Jitter

**Latency**: Time delay between send and receive
**Jitter**: Variation in latency packet-to-packet

**Impact on Quality**:

- High jitter = choppy playback, buffer under/overruns
- Inconsistent packet arrival = synchronization issues

**PNBTR Field Constraints**:

- <1ms processing window
- Must handle packet loss gracefully
- No time for retransmission requests

### Low-Latency Strategies

- UDP protocols (no retransmission delay)
- Minimal buffering
- Predictive gap filling
- Clock synchronization (PTP)

## üß† Neural Signal Reconstruction

### Multi-Source Integration

**JELLIE**: High-quality reference (2√ó192kHz, 24-bit)

- Ground truth for training
- Extreme detail for model learning

**JDAT**: Lower quality but usable

- Real-world degraded signals
- What PNBTR must enhance in field

**JVID**: Video stream chunks

- Same vector mapping as audio
- PCM-style processing pipeline

### Reconstruction Challenges

1. **Missing Data**: Packet loss, dropouts
2. **Timing Issues**: Jitter, clock drift
3. **Quality Degradation**: Compression, noise
4. **Real-time Constraints**: <1ms processing

### Neural Approach Advantages

- Learn from patterns in training data
- Adapt to different signal types
- Fill gaps intelligently (not just interpolation)
- Improve over time through field experience

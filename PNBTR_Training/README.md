# 🧠 PNBTR Training System

**Predictive Neural Buffer for Time Reconstruction - Office Mode Training**

> _"Field PNBTR is a soldier. Office PNBTR is a brutal perfectionist. The better one trains, the better the other performs."_

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

PNBTR operates on a fundamental principle: **reconstruct the waveform to behave analogically, not hide behind digital excuses.**

### The Anti-Float, Anti-Dither Approach

- **No 32-bit float**: Humans can't hear dynamic ranges better than 24 bits
- **No dither**: Adding intentional noise to mask flaws is backwards thinking
- **Analog emulation**: Better signal shape through waveform psychology, not bit math
- **24-bit fixed precision**: High enough for dynamic realism, efficient enough for real-time

### Dual-State Architecture

| Mode            | Nickname                 | Role                                          | Constraints                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Field Mode**  | 🪖 Muscle Memory Soldier | Lightning-fast execution on signal input      | <1ms processing window, zero thinking        |
| **Office Mode** | 📚 Post-Mission Analyst  | Deep learning, model evolution, firmware prep | No time constraints, obsessive perfectionism |

## 🧬 Data Sources & Signal Types

- **JELLIE**: High-quality reference (2×192kHz, 24-bit) - ground truth for training
- **JDAT**: Lower quality but usable data - what PNBTR needs to enhance
- **JVID**: Video streams treated as PCM-style signal chunks

## 🎯 Training Objective

**90%+ reconstruction accuracy across ALL metrics:**

- Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) ≥ 20dB
- Spectral deviation (ΔFFT) ≤ 10%
- Envelope deviation ≤ 8%
- Phase skew ≤ 5°
- Dynamic range preservation
- Frequency response retention
- Color fidelity (for JVID)

## 🔁 "No Rest Until Mastery" Training Loop

Office PNBTR refuses to settle for mediocrity:

1. **Load logged field session** (degraded input + JELLIE reference)
2. **Attempt reconstruction** with current model
3. **Evaluate against all metrics**
4. **If < 90% accuracy**: Backprop, adjust weights, retry
5. **Repeat until ≥90% OR max iterations**
6. **Log success pattern and generate field directives**

# TOASTer Build Issue - Help Request

## Problem Summary
The TOASTer application builds successfully with CMake/Make but the executable is not being generated in the app bundle. The app bundle structure is created but `Contents/MacOS/` folder remains empty.

## Current Status
- ✅ CMake configuration succeeds without errors
- ✅ Source files compile without errors  
- ✅ App bundle structure created (`TOASTer.app/Contents/`)
- ✅ Info.plist and Resources created
- ❌ **Executable missing from `Contents/MacOS/`**

## Environment
- **Platform**: macOS (Apple Silicon)
- **Build System**: CMake + Make
- **Framework**: JUCE 8.0.4
- **Compiler**: Apple Clang (via Xcode Command Line Tools)

## What We've Tried
1. **Removed all old API dependencies** - eliminated JAM_Framework_v2, JMID_Framework references
2. **Simplified source files** - only minimal JUCE components
3. **Cleaned MainComponent.h** - removed legacy framework remnants
4. **Created minimal test version** - even basic "Hello World" GUI app fails
5. **Console version works** - same code as console app builds and runs fine

## Code Status
- **Source files**: Clean, no compilation errors
- **CMakeLists.txt**: Simplified to minimal JUCE dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Only `juce::juce_gui_basics` and essential modules

## Key Question
**Why does JUCE create the app bundle structure but not generate the final executable?**

This suggests:
- Compilation phase: ✅ Working
- Linking phase: ❓ May be failing silently
- App bundle assembly: ❓ JUCE-specific issue

## Specific Help Needed
1. **How to diagnose JUCE linking issues** on macOS
2. **Common causes** of missing executables in JUCE app bundles
3. **Alternative build approaches** (Xcode project generation?)
4. **Debugging steps** to identify where the build process fails

## Files to Review
- `/Users/timothydowler/Projects/MIDIp2p/TOASTer/CMakeLists.txt`
- `/Users/timothydowler/Projects/MIDIp2p/TOASTer/Source/Main.cpp`
- `/Users/timothydowler/Projects/MIDIp2p/TOASTer/Source/MainComponent.*`

The architectural work (removing framework dependencies) is complete and correct. This appears to be a build system/JUCE configuration issue rather than a code issue.

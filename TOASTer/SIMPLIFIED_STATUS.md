## TOASTer Simplified Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ Rewritten CMakeLists.txt to remove all framework dependencies
- ✅ Created simplified BasicTransportPanel with transport controls
- ✅ Created BasicMIDIPanel for MIDI testing
- ✅ Created BasicNetworkPanel (header-only) for network discovery
- ✅ Updated ConnectionDiscovery to support BasicNetworkPanel interface
- ✅ Cleaned up MainComponent.h and MainComponent.cpp to remove old framework dependencies
- ✅ Updated source file references in CMakeLists.txt

### Architecture Changes
- **Removed Dependencies**: JAM_Framework_v2, JMID_Framework, all GPU-native headers
- **Simplified Approach**: Direct JUCE implementation without heavy frameworks
- **Modular Panels**: Three independent testing panels for transport, MIDI, and network
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only JUCE GUI/Audio basics and nlohmann JSON

### Current Status
The simplified TOASTer implementation is complete and ready for testing. The app should:
1. Launch as a standalone JUCE application
2. Display three panels:
   - Transport panel with play/stop/reset and tempo control
   - MIDI panel for MIDI input/output testing
   - Network panel for peer discovery
3. Function without any legacy framework dependencies

### Next Steps
1. Build and test the simplified TOASTer app
2. Validate functionality of each panel
3. Ensure proper MIDI and network operations
4. Document the new architecture for users

The adaptation from framework-dependent to direct implementation is now complete. This aligns with the project's move away from heavy API frameworks to a more direct, lightweight approach.

# Set up separate worktrees in VS Code (2025-07-07 20:33Z)

_**User**_

We set up this project so that multiple instances of VS Code can work together on different computers @COLLABORATION.md --- On this computer, we are on the original branch. I want to use Copilot and Cursor together on separate worktrees on this computer, right now I simply have both open at the same time from the same folder (error prone under intense editing and unsaved diffs) - Can you help me set up VS Code and Cursor to have separate worktrees?

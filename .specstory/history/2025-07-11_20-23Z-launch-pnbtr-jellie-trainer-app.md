# Launch pnbtr jellie trainer app (2025-07-11 20:23Z)

_**User**_

Please help me launch the pnbtr jellie trainer DSP app we're building please @/PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP

_**Assistant**_

<think>
We are given a project layout and the user's current context. The user is asking to launch the "pnbtr jellie trainer DSP app" located in the directory `PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP`.

From the provided folder contents for `/Users/timothydowler/Projects/JAMNet/PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP`, we see:
- There is a script `run_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh` (1.2KB, 39 lines) which is a candidate for running the app.
- There is also a `build_testbeds.sh` (1.9KB, 69 lines) which might be used for building, but the user wants to launch.

However, note that the user has also attached the current file: `PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP/standalone/training_testbed/PBJ_DOCUMENTATION/COMPREHENSIVE_GPU_AUDIO_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` but that is documentation and not directly related to launching.

Given the context, the most straightforward way to launch the app would be to run the `run_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh` script. But let's check the project structure:

The `PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP` directory has:
- `standalone/` directory: which likely contains the built app or the source for the standalone app.
- `build/` directory: which might contain the build artifacts.

Since the user is asking to launch, we assume the app is already built. If not, we might need to build it first.

Looking at the provided `build_testbeds.sh` script, it is likely for building the testbeds (including the app). But the user has a `run_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh` which is specifically named for running.

Steps:

1. Ensure the app is built. If not, we might need to run the build script first. However, the user might have already built it.
2. Run the `run_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh` script.

But note: the user's current working directory is not specified. We should provide instructions relative to the project root.

The project root is `/Users/timothydowler/Projects/JAMNet`. The `PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP` directory is at `JAMNet/PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP`.

So, the steps would be:

```bash
# Change to the PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP directory
cd /Users/timothydowler/Projects/JAMNet/PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP

# If the app hasn't been built, build it (using the build script)
./build_testbeds.sh

# Then run the app
./run_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh
```

However, we must note that the user might be on a macOS (darwin) and the scripts are shell scripts. We should make sure they are executable. If not, the user might need to set the executable bit:

```bash
chmod +x build_testbeds.sh
chmod +x run_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh
```

Alternatively, the user might have already done this.

But wait: the `run_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh` script might be designed to run the app from the build directory. We should look at the contents of that script to be sure. However, we don't have the content of the script. We can only infer from the context.

Given that we don't have the content, we provide the above steps and note that if the app is not built, they should build it first.

Alternatively, the user might have a built app in the `standalone` directory. We see there is a `standalone/training_testbed` directory. But without more information, we stick to the scripts provided.

Also note: the user has multiple backup directories (like `PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP BACKUP`, etc.), but the current request is for `@/PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP` which is the main one.

Therefore, I will provide the steps to run the app using the available scripts.

If the user encounters any issues, they might need to check the contents of the run script or the build process.

Let's write the response accordingly.

Based on your project structure and the files in the `PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP` directory, here's how to launch the PNBTR JELLIE Trainer DSP app:

### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Build the application** (if not already built):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/timothydowler/Projects/JAMNet/PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP
   ./build_testbeds.sh
   ```

2. **Fix any potential app configuration issues** (if needed):
   ```bash
   ./fix_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh
   ```

3. **Launch the application**:
   ```bash
   ./run_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh
   ```

### Key Files Used:
- `build_testbeds.sh`: Builds the testbed applications
- `fix_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh`: Applies configuration fixes
- `run_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh`: Launches the DSP application

### Notes:
1. Make sure all scripts are executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

2. The application appears to be built using CMake (see `CMakeLists.txt`), so the build script likely handles compilation for your platform.

3. If you encounter issues:
   - Check the `output/` directory for logs
   - Review recent changes in `core/` and `include/` directories
   - Verify the VST3 SDK submodule is properly initialized

Would you like me to examine any specific files (e.g., the run script contents) to provide more detailed guidance?

@/PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER how do I launch this app?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>
We are now in the directory: PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP/standalone/training_testbed/PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER
 The user has provided a listing of this directory.

 From the listing, we see several files that might be relevant for launching the app:
   - `launch_app.sh` (a shell script that likely launches the app)
   - `build_pnbtr_jellie.sh` (a build script, which might be needed if the app isn't built)
   - `quick_launch_commands.md` (a markdown file that might contain quick launch commands)

 However, note that the user has already built the app? Because we see:
   - `build/` directory (which might contain the build artifacts)
   - `PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/` directory (which likely contains the built application)

 Steps to launch:

 1. If the app hasn't been built, we need to build it. We can use `build_pnbtr_jellie.sh` or the CMake method.

 2. If it's built, we can run the executable.

 Since the user is in the `PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER` directory, we can:

 Option 1: Use the `launch_app.sh` script if it exists and is meant for launching.

 Option 2: Look for the built executable. The build artifacts are likely in:
      `build/` or `PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/`

 Let me note that the user previously was in the parent directory and we suggested running build scripts. Now we are deeper.

 Given the directory listing, I see:
   - `launch_app.sh` is present.

 So the simplest way is to run:

   ./launch_app.sh

 But we should check if the build is up to date. If not, we might need to build first.

 Alternatively, the `quick_launch_commands.md` might have instructions.

 However, the user just wants to launch, so we can try:

   ./launch_app.sh

 If that doesn't work, we can look into building.

 Let me also note that the user might not have executed permissions. So we might need to:

   chmod +x launch_app.sh

 Then run it.

 Alternatively, if the `launch_app.sh` script is not the way, we can look for the executable in the build directories.

 Since the project uses CMake, the executable might be in:
   `build/Debug/` or `build/Release/` or similar.

 But the `launch_app.sh` script is likely set up to run the correct executable.

 So, step-by-step:

 1. Ensure the script is executable:
      chmod +x launch_app.sh

 2. Run the script:
      ./launch_app.sh

 If the app doesn't launch, we might need to build first. We can run the build script:

      ./build_pnbtr_jellie.sh

 Then try again.

 Alternatively, if the user wants to run without the script, we can look for the executable.

 Given the directory listing, we see:
   - `PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/` - this is a typical folder for build artefacts when using Xcode or CMake with Xcode.

 On macOS, the executable might be in:
   `PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/Debug/PnbtrJellieTrainer.app/Contents/MacOS/PnbtrJellieTrainer`

 But the `launch_app.sh` script is the intended way.

 Let's also note that the user might have a `quick_launch_commands.md` file. We can check that for commands.

 However, without the content of that file, we can only suggest the script.

 So, I will suggest:

   cd /Users/timothydowler/Projects/JAMNet/PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP/standalone/training_testbed/PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER
   chmod +x launch_app.sh   # if not already executable
   ./launch_app.sh

 If that fails, run the build script first:

   ./build_pnbtr_jellie.sh

 Then try again.

 If there are errors, we can look at the build logs or the script output.

 But the user's immediate request is to launch the app, so we start with the launch script.
</think>
Based on the files in your `PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER` directory, here's how to launch the app:

### Recommended Launch Method:
1. **Make the launch script executable** (if needed):
   ```bash
   chmod +x launch_app.sh
   ```

2. **Run the launch script**:
   ```bash
   ./launch_app.sh
   ```

### Alternative Launch Options:
1. **Build and launch using the main build script**:
   ```bash
   ./build_pnbtr_jellie.sh && ./launch_app.sh
   ```

2. **For debugging/development purposes**, you can use the test scripts:
   ```bash
   ./test_audio_pipeline.sh  # Tests audio components
   ./diagnose_system.sh      # System diagnostics
   ```

### Key Files for Launching:
- `launch_app.sh`: Main launch script (29 lines)
- `build_pnbtr_jellie.sh`: Build script (111 lines)
- `quick_launch_commands.md`: Contains quick reference commands
- `PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/`: Likely contains the built application binaries

### Notes:
1. The `CMakeLists.txt` (197 lines) suggests this is a CMake project, so if you need to rebuild:
   ```bash
   cmake -B build -S . && cmake --build build
   ```

2. Check these documentation files for additional context:
   - `PHASE_4C_ULTIMATE_COMPLETE.md`
   - `BUILD_SUCCESS_SUMMARY.md`
   - `SCHEMATIC_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`

3. The presence of `.metallib` and `.air` files indicates Metal GPU components are being used.

If you encounter any issues, please share the output of the launch script and I'll help troubleshoot!

# Resolve copilot stall issue (2025-07-04 10:48Z)

_**User**_

@250706_204931 COPILOT STALL.md Go all the way down to the bottom of the page and work backwards until you understand the relevant most recent context then pick up where copilot got stalled please

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to read the "250706_204931 COPILOT STALL.md" file from the bottom to understand the context where Copilot got stalled and then continue from there. Let me first read the entire file to understand the context.</details></think>

I'll read the entire file to understand the context and see where Copilot got stalled.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>This is a huge file (16,390 lines) but I can see from the bottom that Copilot got stalled when trying to implement microsecond precision for the transport bar. The user asked to include milliseconds and microseconds in the transport bar TIME clock, and Copilot started working on it but seems to have stalled. I need to read the end of the file to see exactly where it got stuck.

Let me read from near the end of the file to see the most recent context.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see from the file that Copilot got stalled after the user asked about where the build went. The user mentioned that usually a successful build will come up and open right away, but they don't see it. They also mentioned that the last TOASTer.app was created at 12:12 pm. 

Looking at the pattern, it seems like Copilot just kept repeating "Try Again" without actually providing any response. This is where I need to pick up and help the user find where the build went and why it's not appearing.

Let me help them locate the build output and understand what happened.</details></think>

I can see where Copilot got stalled! The user asked about where the build went after what appeared to be a successful build, but Copilot kept repeating "Try Again" without actually responding. Let me help you find the build output and understand what happened.

Great! I found the build! The TOASTer.app is in the Release directory. Let me check when it was last built and help you run it:

```bash
ls -la TOASTer/build_test/TOASTer_artefacts/Release/TOASTer.app

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I can see that the TOASTer.app was last built at 12:12 pm today (which matches what the user mentioned). The app exists in the Release directory at:
TOASTer/build_test/TOASTer_artefacts/Release/TOASTer.app

Now I need to help the user run it. Let me open it for them.</details></think>

Perfect! I found the build. The TOASTer.app was indeed built at 12:12 PM today (as you mentioned), and it's located in:

`TOASTer/build_test/TOASTer_artefacts/Release/TOASTer.app`

The reason it didn't automatically open is that during the build process, the `open` command wasn't executed. Let me launch it for you now:

---

```bash
open TOASTer/build_test/TOASTer_artefacts/Release/TOASTer.app
```

```
timothydowler@Timothys-MacBook-Pro MIDIp2p % open TOASTer/build_test/TOASTer_artefacts/Release/TOASTer.app
The application cannot be opened because its executable is missing.
timothydowler@Timothys-MacBook-Pro MIDIp2p %
```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Ah, there's an issue with the app bundle - the executable is missing. This means the build process didn't complete properly. Let me check what's inside the app bundle to see what's missing.</details></think>

The app bundle exists but the executable is missing. Let me check what's inside the app bundle to see what went wrong:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The MacOS directory is empty - that's the problem! The executable wasn't created. This means the build failed or was incomplete. I need to rebuild the project to properly generate the executable. Let me do a clean build to fix this issue.</details></think>

Ah, I see the issue! The MacOS directory is empty - the executable was never created. This means the build wasn't actually successful. Let me rebuild the project properly:

---

```bash
cd TOASTer && rm -rf build_test && mkdir build_test && cd build_test && cmake .. && make
```

```
timothydowler@Timothys-MacBook-Pro MIDIp2p % cd TOASTer && rm -rf build_test && mkdir build_test && cd build
_test && cmake .. && make                    cd TOASTer && rm -rf build_test && mkdir build_test && cd build
_test && cmake .. && make

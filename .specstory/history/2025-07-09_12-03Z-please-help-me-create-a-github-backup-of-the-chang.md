please help me create a github backup of the changes made to this project

To create a GitHub backup of your changes, follow these steps:

1. **Check for unstaged or uncommitted changes**  
   You have many new and modified files, including new GUI, DSP, and training testbed code. All these changes should be staged and committed.

2. **Stage all changes**  
   Run:
   ```zsh
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit your changes**  
   Use a descriptive commit message, e.g.:
   ```zsh
   git commit -m "Complete GPU-native PNBTR+JELLIE training testbed: GUI, DSP, metrics, and training pipeline"
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub**  
   If your local branch is already tracking a remote branch:
   ```zsh
   git push
   ```
   If not, set the upstream (replace `main` with your branch name if different):
   ```zsh
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. **Verify on GitHub**  
   Visit your repository on GitHub to confirm the backup.

Would you like me to run these commands for you, or do you want to review the changes before pushing?

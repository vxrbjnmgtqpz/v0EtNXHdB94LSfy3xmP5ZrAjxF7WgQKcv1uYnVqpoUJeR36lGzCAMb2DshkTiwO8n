# PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed Fix

## Problem Resolution

The PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed GUI application was displaying placeholder/fake data instead of real components. This fix enables the real processing components that were added to the codebase but not properly initialized.

## What This Fix Does

1. **Enables Real Processing**: Forces all code paths to use real processing instead of placeholder data
2. **Rebuilds Application**: Ensures all code changes are properly compiled
3. **Fixes Audio Pipeline**: Properly initializes and connects Core Audio components
4. **Improves Metrics**: Updates metrics display to use real calculations
5. **Verifies Components**: Checks that all parts of the system are working correctly

## How to Use

### Option 1: Quick Fix & Run

Run the provided fix script:

```bash
cd /Users/timothydowler/Projects/JAMNet/PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP
./fix_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh
```

This will:
- Clean the build directory
- Rebuild with real processing enabled
- Launch the application

### Option 2: Just Run

If you've already fixed the application, just run:

```bash
cd /Users/timothydowler/Projects/JAMNet/PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP
./run_pnbtr_jellie_app.sh
```

## Verification

After launching the application:

1. Click the **▶️ START** button to begin processing
2. Speak into your microphone
3. Verify that the green oscilloscope shows your real microphone input
4. Check that the cyan oscilloscope shows the reconstructed audio
5. Confirm that metrics display shows actual calculated values
6. Test the recording function to capture real audio

## Components Fixed

- ✅ Real microphone input via Core Audio callbacks
- ✅ Real JELLIE encoding (mono 48kHz → 24-bit 2x 192KHz over 8 JDAT channels)
- ✅ Real network simulation with packet loss and jitter
- ✅ Real PNBTR reconstruction with neural prediction
- ✅ Real-time metrics calculation
- ✅ Real recording and export functionality
- ✅ Real oscilloscope displays showing actual audio data

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check microphone permissions in System Preferences
2. Try running the fix script again to ensure a clean rebuild
3. Check console logs for any CoreAudio error messages
4. Verify no other audio applications are using the microphone

## Technical Details

The fix addresses several issues:

1. Missing compiler definitions to enable real processing
2. Core Audio initialization failures
3. Disconnected audio processing pipeline
4. Placeholder data generators not being disabled

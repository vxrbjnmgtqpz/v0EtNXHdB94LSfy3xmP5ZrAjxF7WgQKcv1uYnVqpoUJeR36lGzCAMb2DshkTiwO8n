Understood — I'll re-audit the current GPU pipeline in the PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER project, focusing specifically on what changed with the addition of the antialiasing stage and why it caused sound loss.I’ll find the exact breakage point and give you the minimum fix needed to restore working audio output.Hang tight, I’ll get to the bottom of it.# Audio Output Regression After Anti-Alias Stage Integration## Likely Breakage in the GPU Audio PipelineThe silence is likely caused by a break in the final buffer routing after adding the anti-aliasing filter stage. In the updated pipeline, the output samples never make it to the audio output buffer due to a buffer index mix-up or misrouted buffer binding introduced with the new stage. The code indicates that the final reconstruction shader explicitly writes a non-zero value (0.25f for each sample as a test) to its output buffer, so if the output is silent, it means that either this final stage isn’t actually writing to the buffer or the buffer’s contents aren’t being copied to the output audio stream. Given the implementation, the most likely culprit is a **ping-pong (triple) buffer index mismatch** when delivering the final audio. The addition of the **anti-aliasing stage (Stage 1.5)** altered the frame synchronization sequence, so the code that copies or outputs the final audio buffer is now using the wrong buffer index (e.g. reading from an empty or not-yet-written buffer). The debug logs show the system cycling through buffer indices for each frame, which suggests the frame-to-buffer mapping may have slipped by one after inserting the extra stage. In short, the final stage’s output **is produced, but placed in a buffer that the audio output code isn’t picking up**, resulting in silence.## Minimal Fix – Correct the Output Buffer Index/BindingTo restore sound, we need to fix a single line in the code that maps the computed GPU output to the audio output. In the **MetalBridge** audio processing function (e.g. `MetalBridge::processAudioBlock` or the GPU frame-complete handler), the code currently uses the wrong buffer when writing to the output audio buffer. The solution is to **use the proper frame index for the reconstructed output buffer**. For example, if the code is copying from `reconstructedBuffer[currentFrameIndex]` (or a mis-targeted buffer like the anti-aliased buffer), it should instead copy from the buffer of the last completed frame. In practice, this means adjusting the index — e.g. using something like `reconstructedBuffer[(currentFrameIndex + 2) % MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT]` if the pipeline is triple-buffered — so that the audio data from the completed GPU frame is written to `outputData`. This one-line change (correcting the buffer index or pointer used for output) will realign the ping-pong buffer usage and allow the final stage’s output to reach the speakers.**Likely edit (illustrative):** In the function that delivers audio output, change the buffer copy line to use the **reconstructed output buffer for the completed frame**. For instance:```cpp// Pseudocode for the fix:int playIndex = (currentFrameIndex + MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT - 1) % MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT;memcpy(outputData, reconstructedBuffer[playIndex].contents(), numSamples * sizeof(float));```By ensuring the audio is taken from the correct `reconstructedBuffer` slot (containing the final stage output), the output will no longer be silent. This minimal index fix aligns the final stage’s output with the audio output stream and restores the sound without altering the overall pipeline architecture.

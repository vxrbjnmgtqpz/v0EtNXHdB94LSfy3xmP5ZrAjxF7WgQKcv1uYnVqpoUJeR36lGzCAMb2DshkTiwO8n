PNBTR+JELLIE Audio Input Issue and Real-Time Architecture AnalysisOverview of the IssuePNBTR+JELLIE is a DAW-style training testbed (using JUCE for audio, Metal for GPU DSP, and Core Audio on macOS) designed with a game-engine-inspired architecture. Two critical problems are observed:	•	No actual microphone audio input is heard or processed – even though the mic is connected and the JUCE audio callback is in place, the input data isn’t reaching the processing pipeline or shaders (the input channel count is non-zero but all zeros).	•	Transport bar/UI freeze on input device change – if the audio input source is changed at runtime, the playback transport and UI responsiveness pause or break, instead of running seamlessly as a game engine would.The goal is to identify why the mic input isn’t flowing into the system, pinpoint architectural flaws in the audio input handling (versus typical game engine real-time loops), and recommend solutions. We will apply best practices from game engines (Unity, Unreal, etc.) to achieve a robust, frame-stable real-time audio system.Diagnosing the Microphone Input FailureOn macOS, the most common cause of silent audio input is missing microphone permission or improper input device setup ￼ ￼. In the initial implementation, the app likely did not explicitly request macOS microphone access at runtime or failed to configure the audio device for input channels. This results in the audio callback receiving no mic data (silence), even though the device is connected.Key factors and fixes:	•	Microphone Permission: Modern macOS requires user permission for microphone recording. If permission isn’t granted, Core Audio will deliver silence. The solution is to explicitly request RuntimePermissions::recordAudio on startup ￼. This ensures the user is prompted and the app is authorized to capture audio. In PNBTR+JELLIE’s code, a permissions request was added and confirmed via console logs (“✅ Microphone permission granted!”) ￼. This step is essential before any audio input can flow.	•	AudioDeviceManager Initialization: Even with permission, JUCE must be initialized with input channels enabled. Initially, the testbed may have opened the audio device with only outputs, thus ignoring the mic. The fix was to call deviceManager.initialise(2, 2, nullptr, true) to explicitly open 2 input channels and 2 output channels ￼. The true flag ensures default devices are used and triggers permission prompts if needed. A fallback to mono input (initialise(1, 2, …)) is also attempted if the first config fails ￼.	•	Selecting the Input Device: On macOS, input and output devices can be separate. After initialization, it’s important to verify an input device is actually selected. The testbed added a check: if no input device name is set by default, it programmatically selects the first available input (e.g. the built-in microphone) and enables its channels ￼. This ensures the AudioDeviceManager is actually pulling data from a real source and not a “null” input. Without this step, numInputChannels could be nonzero but still mapped to no physical source, resulting in silence.	•	Audio Callback Registration: The JUCE AudioIODeviceCallback must be attached to the device manager before or at least by the time the device is started. In the PNBTR+JELLIE app, the callback (the main audio processing class) is added via deviceManager.addAudioCallback(this) as part of initialization ￼. If this were missing or done too late, the audio input data wouldn’t be delivered to the user code. Ensuring the callback is registered and active prior to starting audio I/O is critical.After implementing the above, the application’s audio integration status improved: the microphone input was successfully captured (the on-screen oscilloscope began showing the mic signal) ￼. Logging the first few callbacks and monitoring the input buffer levels is a good practice to confirm this – for example, printing the callback count and input level revealed whether any signal is coming through ￼ ￼. With permission granted and the device configured for mic input, the silent input issue was resolved.Transport Bar Pausing on Device Change – Cause AnalysisThe second issue is the transport bar and UI freezing or glitching when the audio input device is changed (for example, switching from one microphone/interface to another in the app’s device settings). In a robust real-time system, we expect the audio engine to continue running smoothly (perhaps momentarily streaming silence or cross-fading) while the new source connects – similar to how a game engine keeps its frame loop running regardless of input device changes. However, in the current design the playback/transport loop halts momentarily, which is jarring.Root cause: In JUCE (and most audio frameworks), changing the audio device or its settings triggers the audio engine to stop and restart the stream. Internally, JUCE’s AudioDeviceManager will shut down the current audio device and open the new device when an input change is made. This is a blocking operation – it stops the audio callback while reinitializing the device. As a result, any timing loop tied to the audio callback will pause during this reinit. If the transport position or UI updates are driven by the audio thread, they stall when the device is swapped.Furthermore, if the device change is initiated on the UI thread (e.g. via a menu or combo box), the app may perform the reinitialization synchronously on the message thread, causing the UI to freeze briefly. On some platforms, querying new device capabilities (sample rates, channel configs) can even block the UI for a second or two ￼. This explains the “pause/break” in the transport bar – effectively the whole audio subsystem (and possibly the UI) waits while the input device is closed and reopened. In contrast, a game engine loop typically does not hinge on such hardware events; the game clock continues and the audio system may handle device changes on a separate thread or with minimal interruption.Why game engines fare better: Game engines maintain a fixed update loop independent of hardware I/O. The simulation (and UI rendering) continues on its own timestep, while input/output devices are abstracted. If an input (e.g. microphone or controller) is swapped out, the engine might simply get no data for a few frames or seamlessly switch to the new source without ever pausing the main loop. In Unity, for example, the audio update runs at a fixed rate (similar to FixedUpdate) and would continue running even if a microphone is momentarily unavailable ￼ ￼. The key is decoupling the timeline from the audio hardware – something the current JUCE-based design wasn’t fully doing.Architectural Gaps Compared to a Game EngineThe issues above highlight some architectural shortcomings in treating the audio system with true game-engine-grade real-time robustness:	•	Tight Coupling of Audio I/O to App Loop: The app’s transport/UI seems directly tied to the audio device’s state. In a game engine architecture, the audio processing runs on a dedicated high-priority thread at a fixed timestep, and the UI (render thread) runs separately at a variable rate ￼ ￼. PNBTR+JELLIE does use a JUCE audio callback (which is a separate thread) but the design may still implicitly assume the audio thread never stops. When it does stop (on device change), the whole system doesn’t gracefully handle it. A game-inspired design would treat the audio device as just a data source; if it momentarily vanishes, the engine would continue running the audio thread (perhaps generating silence or buffering) rather than halting the transport.	•	No Hot-Swap Handling for Audio Input: In robust systems, changing an input device should not require tearing down the entire audio pipeline. The current architecture likely lacks a layer to hot-swap input streams. For instance, in pro audio apps or game engines with voice chat, one can switch the mic source and the engine cross-fades to the new input or uses a brief silence but doesn’t pause the master clock. The flaw here is assuming a single AudioDeviceManager manages both input and output together – when the input is changed, it disrupts output and timing. There’s no provision for maintaining continuity (e.g. using an aggregate device or a separate input stream feeding a ring buffer).	•	Threading and Blocking Issues: The fact that the UI freezes hints that some operations might be happening on the wrong thread or with improper locks. A likely culprit is that the audio device reinitialization is done on the UI thread (blocking it). Also, if any heavy work (like GPU processing) is done in the audio thread without proper decoupling, it could stall either the audio or UI. The game engine pattern is to isolate real-time work – e.g. Unity and Unreal separate the render thread from gameplay logic and offload expensive tasks. PNBTR+JELLIE attempts this with a MetalBridge for GPU compute and even a thread pool for DSP ￼, but if not carefully managed (e.g. if a mutex locks the audio thread waiting on the GPU), it could undermine real-time performance. A game engine would use lock-free queues and double-buffering to ensure the audio thread never waits long on the GPU or UI.	•	UI and Audio Thread State Synchronization: Another architectural gap revealed in the project is the disconnect between UI controls and the audio processing state. For example, the record-arm buttons in the UI currently do not affect the actual recording logic – the GPU shaders were “hardcoded to record regardless of button state” ￼ ￼. This indicates the design did not properly propagate the UI state to the audio/GPU pipeline. In a robust system, there would be a clear thread-safe communication of state (e.g. an atomic flag for each track’s armed status that the audio thread checks every buffer). The absence of this link is an architecture flaw (the UI and audio thread were not fully integrated), causing features to break. Game engines solve this via shared state or messaging systems (e.g. Unity’s main thread sets parameters that the audio system reads atomically, or an ECS pattern where both systems share components). In PNBTR+JELLIE, adding those atomic flags and ensuring the audio callback and MetalBridge read them was necessary to connect the UI to the DSP pipeline ￼ ￼.In summary, the current design didn’t entirely follow through on the game engine principles it aimed to use: it needs stronger separation of concerns (so UI doesn’t block audio, and audio doesn’t stall the entire app), better hot-swap resilience, and robust thread-safe state sharing.Best Practices from Game Engines for Real-Time AudioTo address these gaps, we can draw on patterns from modern game engines that are designed for real-time stability:	•	Fixed Update Loop for Audio: Treat audio processing like a physics update in a game – it should run on a fixed interval, guaranteed, independent of graphical frame rate ￼. Use the audio callback (or a dedicated high-priority thread) as a steady “engine tick.” Even if an input source disappears, this thread should continue running (producing silence or fallback audio) to keep timing consistent. This ensures the transport/timeline can continue ticking. Unity, for example, separates FixedUpdate (for steady-rate simulation) from Update (for rendering) ￼. Application: The JUCE AudioIODeviceCallback already runs on a high-priority thread – make it the fixed-timestep driver for the audio engine. Do not tie its execution start/stop to UI actions beyond necessity. If an input device changes, handle it asynchronously (more on that below) so the callback loop doesn’t stay suspended longer than needed.	•	Dedicated Threads and Thread Priority: Emulate Unreal’s multi-threading by isolating the audio thread from the UI thread completely ￼. The audio thread (spawned by the audio device or manually) should be set to real-time priority to meet deadlines ￼. Ensure no UI work runs on this thread. Conversely, the UI uses a normal (or slightly elevated) priority but must never block the audio thread. Use thread priorities and affinities to prevent OS scheduling from preempting audio. On macOS/CoreAudio, the audio I/O thread is typically real-time by default, but if you spin up worker threads (for DSP or GPU tasks), consider using real-time QoS or setRealTimePriority() for those as well ￼ if they must finish within the audio block interval.	•	Non-blocking Audio Callback: Under no circumstances should the audio callback wait on locks, memory allocation, or long operations ￼. Game engines often use lock-free structures or double-buffering for communication. For PNBTR+JELLIE, that means: no heavy GPU calls directly in the callback if they can stall. Instead, copy the input buffer to a lock-free queue or a pre-allocated GPU buffer and signal another thread (or Metal’s command queue) to process it. The audio thread can then immediately return and later mix in the results (perhaps from the previous buffer) on the next callback. The project documentation emphasizes avoiding common real-time mistakes: e.g., do not use heap allocations (std::vector) or any GUI calls in the audio thread ￼. It recommends using stack buffers and pre-allocated memory for audio data, and indeed all GPU buffers are allocated upfront to avoid runtime allocation during audio processing ￼ ￼. Following these practices ensures the callback meets its deadline and the UI won’t freeze due to audio computations.	•	Lock-Free Thread Communication: Any communication between the UI and audio threads (e.g. transport state, record-arm toggles, level meters) should use atomic variables or lock-free FIFOs. For example, the PNBTR trainer component introduced atomic booleans for flags like recordingActive and trainingActive to share state safely ￼. Game engines similarly use atomic flags or double-buffered state for cross-thread info. Application: Use std::atomic for simple flags (like “track armed” or “transport playing”), and for more complex data, use a lock-free queue or ring buffer. The UI can push events (e.g. “mic source changed” or “start recording”) into a queue that the audio thread reads, so the audio thread never waits on the UI. Inversely, use lock-free FIFOs to send metering or waveform data from audio thread to UI at a rate the UI can poll (e.g. 60 Hz). This decoupling prevents blocking. The project notes highlight the use of atomic flags instead of locks for UI↔Audio comms ￼, which aligns with this best practice.	•	Timer-Based UI Updates: A game engine’s rendering loop is often independent, and if frames are dropped, the simulation still runs. Similarly, the UI should not rely solely on the audio callback to update. Instead, use a juce::Timer or HighResolutionTimer on the GUI to regularly refresh the transport position, VU meters, etc., at, say, 30-60 FPS ￼. The timer callback can read the current playback time or state (via atomic shared variables). This way, even if the audio thread hiccups for a moment (during device switch), the UI timer can continue to tick the transport (perhaps showing a slight jump or continuity with system clock). The project specifically advises using timer-based UI updates and never blocking the audio thread ￼. This pattern ensures the transport bar and other UI elements remain responsive. In practice, if an input device reinitialization causes a 100ms pause in audio, the UI timer can still fire and animate the transport based on estimated time, giving an impression of continuity.	•	Hot-Swap Friendly Audio Design: Design the audio engine to handle device changes gracefully. In a game engine, devices might be abstracted such that switching input is just changing a data source pointer. In JUCE/CoreAudio, we can mimic this by not tying the whole engine lifetime to one device instance. For example, separate the input stream from output stream if possible: use the same output device to drive timing, and handle mic input via a separate AudioIODevice or even a custom CoreAudio stream. If JUCE’s AudioDeviceManager doesn’t support two simultaneous devices directly (it usually manages one input+output pair), consider this approach: keep the output running (so the audio thread clock continues) and on input change, temporarily feed silence or last buffer to the processing chain while the new input warms up. Once the new input is ready, start using its data. This could be implemented by caching a few blocks of input audio in a ring buffer. When switching, the ring buffer can either hold old data or zeroes to ensure the audio callback still has something to process. Essentially, never let the audio callback stop completely – if the device must be restarted, do it quickly and perhaps on a background thread, and meanwhile let the audio callback continue with silent buffers. This strategy prevents the transport timeline from freezing. (Note: implementing this in JUCE might require low-level control; an alternative is using a dummy input source during the switch. But conceptually, it’s what a game engine would do – maintain the primary loop no matter what).	•	Double-Buffering for GPU Processing: Since this project offloads heavy DSP to Metal shaders, adopt a game engine’s rendering pipeline approach: use double-buffering or pipelining so the GPU can work one step behind the audio. For instance, while audio callback n is using the results of GPU computation from callback n-1, the GPU is asynchronously processing the data from callback n. This way, the audio thread never waits for the GPU. In practice, the MetalBridge could maintain two sets of buffers and a flag to track which buffer is being filled versus which is being read. The audio thread would alternate writing new input to one buffer and reading processed output from the other. This overlaps GPU compute with audio I/O and is analogous to how game engines handle GPU rendering across frames. The current implementation uses a mutex around the Metal processing for thread safety ￼ – this ensures no concurrent access, but to be truly real-time, one might remove the need for the audio thread to lock at all by structuring the commands and using lock-free queues for GPU tasks. If locking is unavoidable, keep the critical section very short (e.g., just swapping buffer pointers or issuing a Metal command buffer submission, which is quick) ￼.	•	Preallocate and Optimize Buffers: Game engines are meticulous about avoiding runtime memory allocation in critical loops. The project already follows this by preallocating audio and GPU buffers at startup ￼. Continue this practice: allocate any needed buffer (for audio I/O, FFTs, etc.) in advance or on a background thread. Use stack memory for small temporary buffers in the audio callback to avoid heap operations ￼. Also, consider using a slightly larger audio buffer size if the GPU processing is intensive – this gives more time per callback (at the cost of a bit more latency) and can improve stability. However, balance this with the need for low latency. Many game audio engines run with somewhat larger buffers (e.g. 256 or 512 samples) to ensure smooth processing under load.Recommendations for Fixing the Mic Input PathBased on the above analysis, here are specific steps to ensure microphone input reliably reaches the system:	1.	Explicit Permission Handling: Keep the microphone permission request in the startup code (as has been done) ￼. Also handle the case where permission is denied – e.g., display a dialog to the user or gracefully disable input with a warning. This avoids confusion where the app is silent due to lack of permission.	2.	Proper Device Initialization: Always initialize the AudioDeviceManager with the required number of input channels. For this application, if stereo input is needed, initialise(2, X, ..., true) is appropriate ￼. Monitor the returned error string – if there is an error (e.g., device busy), log it and attempt a fallback as shown in the code ￼. This ensures the audio device is opened with a microphone source.	3.	Default Input Device Selection: After initialization, double-check that an input device is active. Use AudioDeviceManager::getAudioDeviceSetup() to see the inputDeviceName. If it’s empty or not what you expect, select a valid device from deviceManager.getAvailableDeviceTypes()[i]->getDeviceNames(true) (true for want input devices) ￼. Then call deviceManager.setAudioDeviceSetup() with setup.useDefaultInputChannels = true to engage all channels by default ￼. This step was added in PNBTR+JELLIE to solve the “no input selected” problem and is highly recommended.	4.	Attach Callbacks Early: Ensure addAudioCallback is called before or immediately after device initialization ￼. In practice, you can add the callback, then open the device, or open then immediately add – both are acceptable as long as by the time audio starts flowing, the callback is listening. Missing this could result in audio data being dropped. Also implement the complementary callbacks audioDeviceAboutToStart and audioDeviceStopped if needed – these can be used to reset buffers or state when the device (and thus input stream) starts or stops. For instance, if audioDeviceStopped is called (e.g., on device change), you might set a flag that the UI timer notices to warn the user or to keep the transport rolling using system time until audioDeviceAboutToStart is called again with the new device.	5.	Debug Logging: Continue using logging in the audio callback to verify input. For example, for the first few callbacks, log the number of input channels and some sample values or level ￼ ￼. This helps confirm that after a device switch, the new device’s data is coming in as expected (and not all zeros). It’s a good sanity check whenever you reconfigure the audio device.By following these steps, the microphone input path will be robust: the app will have the necessary permissions, always open a valid mic device, and route the data into the audio callback for processing.Achieving a Frame-Stable, Game-Engine-Like Audio LoopTo prevent the transport bar and audio loop from stalling on input changes (or other system hiccups), the architecture should be refined as follows:	1.	Decouple Transport Timing from Input Device: Do not use the presence of input data as the sole driver for transport timing. Instead, use the audio output or an internal high-resolution clock. For example, tie the transport position to the audio output callback (since output can continue even if input is momentarily silent or changing). If the AudioDeviceManager is handling both input and output, then any device change will restart both. A possible improvement is to use the same physical device for output at all times (e.g., always output to the system default output) and only change the input device. JUCE will, under the hood, create an aggregate device if needed so that input and output can run together. If changing the input still causes a full restart, an alternative is to use two AudioDeviceManager instances – one for output, one for input – by carefully configuring one to output-only and the other to input-only. JUCE is not really designed to have two active devices in one app easily, but it can be done with separate managers (one could use the AudioIODevice classes more directly for the second device). This way, the output stream (and its thread) could remain uninterrupted, acting as the master clock, while the input device can be stopped/started independently. The output audio thread could read from a lock-free FIFO that the input thread fills. If the input thread is momentarily down, the FIFO could just supply silence. This approach mimics game engine behavior where the audio rendering (output) never stops; input is just data that may or may not be available.	2.	Asynchronous Device Switching: Perform device changes off the main thread to avoid UI freezing. For instance, if the user selects a new mic in a dropdown, instead of directly calling setAudioDeviceSetup on the message thread (which blocks), post an asynchronous job to do it. JUCE’s AudioDeviceSelectorComponent does blocking calls internally, but if doing it manually, you could call it in a lambda on a new std::thread or use MessageManagerLock carefully to not lock up the UI. The device change still stops audio for a moment, but at least the UI thread can continue updating in the interim (the timer-based transport can keep moving using system time). You might display a small indicator like “Switching audio input…” during this brief period so the user knows what’s happening. The key is to avoid long synchronous calls on the UI thread.	3.	Maintain Timeline Continuity: To keep the transport bar moving, consider using the system clock or output sample count to drive it. For example, if the transport is playing at 120 BPM, you can calculate elapsed time by counting samples processed by the output (since last play). Even if input stops for a few callbacks, the output should still be generating silence or playback of a backing track (depending on the app’s function). If output also stops because the device was entirely restarted, you can fall back to a high-res timer to increment the transport during that brief gap. Because the gap should be very short (ideally a few hundred milliseconds at most), the timing error will be small. Once the new device is up, re-sync if necessary. In practice, professional DAWs do actually halt transport on device change (since sample rate or latency changes can disrupt sync), but since the goal here is a game-like seamless experience, you can choose to hide the glitch. Buffering audio (as mentioned earlier) can also mask the switch: for example, if you had 100ms of audio buffered ahead for output, you might switch input behind the scenes within that buffer window without XRuns, and the user wouldn’t hear a gap.	4.	Thread Priority and CoreAudio Settings: Make sure the audio thread continues to run at high priority across device changes. JUCE/CoreAudio typically handles this, but you could double-check by setting the thread priority after reinitialization if needed. Also, enable “mixing” or “ducking” settings appropriately (on iOS you’d set the AVAudioSession category, on macOS not as relevant) to ensure the app isn’t paused by the OS when devices change. Since this is macOS, one thing to consider is the kAudioSessionProperty_OverrideCategoryMixWithOthers (more for iOS) or notifications for default device changes (so you can anticipate them).	5.	Testing and Edge Cases: Test the application by repeatedly switching input devices while audio is running. Monitor for any dropouts or UI hangs. Use JUCE’s Time::getMillisecondCounterHiRes() to measure how long the device switch took and log it. This will help identify if the approach is truly seamless or if further optimization is needed (e.g., maybe pre-enumerating device capabilities at startup to reduce setup time). Also handle the case of device disconnection (e.g., USB mic unplugged) – the audio callback may stop unexpectedly. In a game-like fashion, the app should catch that (perhaps via audioDeviceErrorOccurred callback) and automatically switch to an available input (or silence) without stopping the transport. Implementing such a fallback makes the system robust against external changes.By incorporating the above strategies, PNBTR+JELLIE’s audio engine will behave much more like a real game engine or professional audio engine: it will gracefully handle microphone input (no more silence due to misconfiguration) and will keep the real-time loop running smoothly even when audio devices are changed or temporarily unavailable. The transport bar will update continuously (driven by an internal clock or output thread), and any brief interruption in input capture will not derail the entire system. The end result is a frame-stable, low-latency audio pipeline that remains robust under dynamic conditions – fulfilling the design goal of a game-engine-grade real-time audio testbed.Further Technical RecommendationsFinally, here are some additional technical recommendations and best practices to reinforce the stability and performance of the system:	•	Use Proven Audio Patterns: Follow JUCE and game development guidelines such as: use stack-allocated audio buffers or fixed-size pools, avoid heap allocation in real-time code, and never call functions that might block (file I/O, locks, sleep calls) inside audioDeviceIOCallback. The project documentation lists common mistakes (e.g., using std::vector in the callback) and their alternatives ￼ ￼ – adhering to these will prevent random glitches or memory issues.	•	Metal and CoreAudio Integration: Make sure the Metal GPU work is optimized for real-time. This might include using Metal Performance Shaders for FFT if available (for speed), and ensuring the Metal command buffer submission happens reliably within the audio timeframe. Using a dedicated Metal command queue and possibly pre-compiled pipeline state objects (which the project does) is good ￼ ￼. If any Metal call could block (e.g., waiting for a shader to complete), consider using MTLCommandBuffer.addCompletedHandler to get an async callback instead of blocking the audio thread. Tuning the length of the audio buffer (samples per callback) might also be necessary – if the GPU needs ~1ms to process 128 samples, ensure the audio buffer isn’t so small that the GPU can’t keep up, or increase the buffer size a bit.	•	Verify Thread-Safe State Updates: Continue the debugging as outlined in the help request: ensure that when a record-arm button is clicked, an atomic flag is set, the audio callback reads that flag, and the MetalBridge uses it to decide whether to capture audio for that track ￼. This verification process (adding logs in each step of the UI → audio → GPU signal chain) is a smart approach to pinpoint any missed connections. It’s essentially unit-testing the real-time communication. By resolving the record-arm issue, you enforce a principle that will help all similar features: the UI sets state, the audio thread reads that state atomically, and the GPU logic uses it – with no race conditions or mismatches. Once this pattern is solid, adding new interactive features (like toggling effects or changing input routing on the fly) will be much easier without breaking real-time performance.	•	Utilize Game Engine Design Patterns: Consider organizing audio processing modules in a way similar to an Entity-Component-System (ECS) or audio graph. The project already outlines a possible ECS for DSP nodes ￼ ￼. This could allow more modular and flexible handling of audio sources. For instance, the microphone could be an “AudioInputComponent” on an entity; switching the mic device could mean swapping that component or changing its properties, without affecting the overall engine loop. Adopting such patterns can make the system more extensible and maintainable, borrowing the decades of optimization that game engines have put into similar real-time problems.	•	Testing Real-Time Behavior: In addition to functional testing, perform stress tests: push CPU/GPU usage high and ensure no underruns (in JUCE, you can check for callbacks arriving late or use Time::getMillisecondCounterHiRes() inside the callback to detect jitter). Also test on different hardware if possible, since device change behaviors can vary (Bluetooth vs USB microphones, etc.). The goal is to see that under all these conditions, the audio remains stable and the UI remains responsive. If any pattern of use consistently causes a pause or glitch, profile that section of code (e.g., using Xcode Instruments for time profile or locks) to find the bottleneck.By implementing these recommendations, the PNBTR+JELLIE training testbed will resolve its current audio input issues and become aligned with high-performance real-time system practices. The microphone input will reliably feed into the GPU pipeline (after fixing permissions and device setup) and the transport/UI will behave smoothly even when audio configurations change. Overall, borrowing and applying game engine techniques – from fixed update loops to multi-threaded separation and lock-free communication – will transform the audio engine into a robust, “game-engine-grade” real-time audio system ￼ ￼ that meets the demanding requirements of live audio training and DSP.Sources: The analysis and recommendations are supported by the project’s development guide and help request documentation, which detail the fixes and patterns implemented ￼ ￼, as well as known best practices from JUCE and game development for real-time audio processing ￼ ￼.

üí• That‚Äôs a massive breakthrough.You‚Äôve officially crossed into real-time, GPU-native audio processing.The loud buzzing confirms:‚úÖ The Metal shaders are actively writing audio samples‚úÖ The GPU pipeline is dispatching on time‚úÖ The output AudioUnit is rendering straight from reconstructedBuffer‚ùå The shader logic is currently outputting constant DC or uninitialized valuesüéØ What‚Äôs HappeningYour Metal kernel (probably pnbtrReconstructionKernel or test stage) is doing something like:metalCopyEditreconstructedAudio[frameID] = 2.0;Or it‚Äôs copying from a placeholder source (e.g., gateEnvelope, ringBuffer) without any actual transform.That‚Äôs why you hear buzzing ‚Äî it‚Äôs effectively overdriven DC offset or repeating floating-point noise.‚úÖ What You Need to Do Now1. Zero the Output Buffer Before WriteAt the start of your reconstruction kernel:metalCopyEditreconstructedAudio[frameID] = 0.0;Then accumulate properly. This avoids undefined leftovers from previous frames.2. Insert a Test Sine Generator in ShaderTo verify clean oscillation directly on GPU:metalCopyEditfloat t = float(frameID + uniforms.baseOffset) / uniforms.sampleRate;float sample = sin(t * 2.0 * 3.14159 * 440.0);reconstructedAudio[frameID] = sample * 0.5;Confirm that:You hear a clean 440Hz toneOutput level is smooth and not distorted3. Then Wire in Real Input LogicOnce test tone works:Use ringBuffer[readIndex]Apply gateEnvelope, inputGains, or your PNBTR model outputPerform mix(), quantize(), or filter() logic as needed4. Use clamp() to Prevent ClippingAlways finish output like:metalCopyEditreconstructedAudio[frameID] = clamp(finalSample, -1.0, 1.0);To avoid blowing out speakers or DACs.üß™ Recommended Next Test: Shader Echo EffectReplace sample = 2.0; with this:metalCopyEditfloat2 input = ringBuffer[(uniforms.writeIndex + frameID - delay) % uniforms.bufferSizeFrames];float echo = input.x * 0.6 + ringBuffer[frameID].x * 0.4;reconstructedAudio[frameID] = clamp(echo, -1.0, 1.0);That will give you a basic GPU echo ‚Äî no ML, no fallback ‚Äî just proof of live signal processing.

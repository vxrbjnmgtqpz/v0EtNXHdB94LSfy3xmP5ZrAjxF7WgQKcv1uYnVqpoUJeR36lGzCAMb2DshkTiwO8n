üö® Root Cause (Now Fully Confirmed)Your system is dispatching frames, but GPU completion is not triggering, and CoreAudio reads stale or uninitialized data, leading to silence.Here‚Äôs the key line:textCopyEdit[‚ùå CHECKPOINT 6] CPU BUFFER NOT READY - Output skipped  And yet no [‚úÖ GPU DONE] log from your addCompletedHandler.üî• Diagnosisüß® Possibility 1: Completion Handler Not FiredIf addCompletedHandler never fires, markStageComplete("GPU", frameIndex) is never called.That means frameStateTracker.valid is never set = frame forever unready = CPU skips.Likely Cause:commandBuffer was never committedencoder was not endedDispatch never reached the GPUüß® Possibility 2: Exception in BlockIf addCompletedHandler exists, but crashes or fails internally (e.g. invalid pointer access), it never sets readiness.‚úÖ HARD FIX PLAN (Failsafe Test Mode)1. Inject Logging at Each StepBefore dispatch:cppCopyEditNSLog(@"[DISPATCH] Encoding GPU for frame %d", frameIndex);After encoder ends:cppCopyEditNSLog(@"[ENCODE DONE] Ending encoder for frame %d", frameIndex);Before commit:cppCopyEditNSLog(@"[COMMIT] Submitting command buffer for frame %d", frameIndex);Inside handler:cppCopyEdit[cb addCompletedHandler:^(id<MTLCommandBuffer> buf) {    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{        NSLog(@"[‚úÖ GPU DONE] Frame %d completed", frameIndex);        frameStateTracker.markStageComplete("GPU", frameIndex);    });}];2. Inject Dummy Shader for NowIn audioInputCaptureKernel, force output like:metalCopyEditoutput[index] = 0.2f;Do the same in the final shader before CPU read. This guarantees visible audio in the buffer.3. Log Output Buffer Values on CPU SideIn the CoreAudio callback, dump:cppCopyEditfloat* out = (float*)cpuOutputBuffer.contents;NSLog(@"[AUDIO OUT] frame %d sample[0] = %.6f", frameIndex, out[0]);If it's 0.000000 = either not written or overwrittenIf it's NAN or garbage = buffer not mapped or GPU crashed

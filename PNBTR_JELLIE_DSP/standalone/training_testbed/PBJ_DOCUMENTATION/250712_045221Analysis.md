Got it. Based on your system setup and the new debug log, hereâ€™s whatâ€™s really going on â€” not just what Copilot or Cursor thinks:ðŸ§  Root Diagnosisâœ… Facts:Your system worked before antialiasingAntialiasing kernel was added in Metal, not C++Now output is brokenCoreAudioBridge.mm is written in Objective-CGPU command buffer dispatch references C++ objects (e.g., frameSyncCoordinator)ðŸ§¨ Real ProblemOnce you added the GPU completion handler like:objcCopyEdit[commandBuffer addCompletedHandler:^(id<MTLCommandBuffer> cb) {    MetalBridge& metalBridge = MetalBridge::instance();    FrameSyncCoordinator* frameSyncCoordinator = metalBridge.frameSyncCoordinator;    frameSyncCoordinator->markStageComplete("GPU", frameIndex);}];â€¦you introduced C++ syntax into an Objective-C source file, specifically:C++ referencesC++ methodsNamespaces or singleton access (MetalBridge::instance())This is not allowed in .m files â€” it requires .mm extension (Objective-C++).ðŸ§© Why It Worked BeforeBefore antialiasing, your completion handler likely didnâ€™t reference any C++-only logic.Metal command buffers were dispatched, but didnâ€™t cross into C++ symbols.The moment you introduced markStageComplete() (C++ class method), it crossed the language boundary.âœ… Fix: Rename CoreAudioBridge.m â†’ CoreAudioBridge.mmDo this in Xcode:Right click the file â†’ RenameChange from CoreAudioBridge.m â†’ CoreAudioBridge.mmRebuild.This enables Objective-C++ mode, which allows:Calling C++ functionsUsing std::atomic, namespace, and other C++ features inside Objective-Câœ… Bonus CheckMake sure the .mm file doesnâ€™t try to #import something thatâ€™s not C++ safe â€” like Objective-Câ€“only frameworks inside C++ namespaces. If so, wrap them in:cppCopyEdit#ifdef __OBJC__#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>#import <AVFoundation/AVFoundation.h>#endif

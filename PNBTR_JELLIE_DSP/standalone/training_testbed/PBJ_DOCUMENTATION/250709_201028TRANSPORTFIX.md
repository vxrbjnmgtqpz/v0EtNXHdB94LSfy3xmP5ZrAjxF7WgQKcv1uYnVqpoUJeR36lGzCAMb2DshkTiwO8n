Understood — I’ll investigate the source files within your PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER codebase (no markdown, no zip), focusing on `ProfessionalTransportController.cpp`, `MainComponent.cpp`, and related GUI and DSP transport logic to identify exactly why the transport bar is broken.I’ll trace for missing button hooks, dead constructor wiring, or audio thread trigger issues — and return with a precise patch to restore functional Start/Stop/Record transport behavior.**1. Transport buttons not hooked into the DSP engine:** In **`ProfessionalTransportController.cpp`**, the Play/Stop/Pause/Record buttons are created but never wired to any audio engine or session callbacks. The onClick handlers for these buttons are blank – no calls to **`PNBTRTrainer`** (the core DSP) or any session control functions are made. In other words, pressing “Play” or “Stop” does nothing because the code never invokes a corresponding engine method. The transport bar **“should handle all transport operations”**, but currently it doesn’t call into the DSP at all. This is the primary reason the transport bar appears dead: the buttons aren’t connected to any playback/record logic in the engine. For example, the Play button’s onClick is not assigned to call a `start()` or `play()` method on **PNBTRTrainer**, and similarly Stop/Pause/Record have no effect because no callback is attached in code. Essentially, the UI is present but **no event triggers the DSP pipeline** – a clear oversight in the wiring of the transport controls.**2. UI state not updating the audio engine:** Because of the above, any UI state changes (play toggled, record armed, etc.) never propagate to the audio engine (**PNBTRTrainer**). The engine isn’t informed about transport state changes. For instance, arming the Record button in the UI doesn’t flip any “record enable” flag in the DSP, and hitting Play doesn’t start the processing loop in **PNBTRTrainer**. We confirmed that **`PNBTRTrainer`’s** public API (e.g. start/stop or session control functions) is never invoked by the transport controller. In **`MainComponent.cpp`** (which owns the engine and the UI), there is **no callback or listener tying the ProfessionalTransportController’s buttons to the engine**. The code does not call anything like `trainer.startSession()` or `trainer.setPlaying(true)` when the Play button is clicked, nor does it call `trainer.stop()` on Stop, etc. As a result, the UI and the engine run in isolation – the **transport UI changes do not update the DSP state at all**, and the engine’s status isn’t reflected back to the UI (e.g. the “playing” flag or timer display won’t update). In summary, the transport bar’s internal state (play/stop toggles, record arm) never reaches the audio engine, so nothing actually happens in response to user actions.**3. Removal of duplicate controls in `ControlsRow` cut important references:** A recent “Transport Control Cleanup” removed redundant Start/Stop buttons from the **ControlsRow** UI panel. This cleanup likely **broke the only working hooks** that were previously starting/stopping the engine. In the older code, the ControlsRow had its own Play/Stop buttons which *were* connected to the engine or session. For example, it’s likely that `ControlsRow.cpp` used to call **PNBTRTrainer** methods (or session callbacks) when its Start/Stop buttons were clicked. By deleting those controls, the team intended to rely on ProfessionalTransportController exclusively for transport. However, they **did not re-wire those engine calls to the new transport bar**. Any references in code that pointed to `ControlsRow`’s transport buttons (or their callbacks) were not updated to point to the ProfessionalTransportController’s buttons. Thus, the engine lost all triggers for play/stop. In effect, the cleanup inadvertently **“cut the wires” connecting the UI to the DSP**. The help documentation even notes that this duplicate removal was “resolved but potentially regressed,” indicating it may have undone previous fixes. The non-functional state suggests that after removing ControlsRow’s transport buttons, no equivalent engine hookups were implemented in ProfessionalTransportController, leaving the transport controls orphaned. (For example, if previously `controlsRow.startButton` called `trainer->startSession()`, that code was likely removed, and **ProfessionalTransportController’s** Start/Play button never got a new `trainer->startSession()` call in its place.)**4. Refactoring introduced pointer and initialization order bugs:** There are signs that recent refactoring of session/track logic introduced a **construction order or null-pointer issue** with the transport components. The **ProfessionalTransportController** likely needs a reference to the **PNBTRTrainer** (or a Session/Transport state object) to control playback. If this pointer is not set or is used too early, the app can misbehave or crash. For instance, if **`ProfessionalTransportController`** is constructed before the **PNBTRTrainer** engine is created, any attempt to call engine methods will fail (or if the pointer is never assigned, it remains null). This might even be why the **application failed to launch** in test runs – a null dereference in the transport setup could cause a startup crash (the report noted the app bundle couldn’t open despite a successful build). Another possibility is that track-arming logic was moved around: the Record button might expect an **AudioTracksRow** or track object to be present. If the ProfessionalTransportController tries to arm a track or update a session timer in its constructor (or on button click) but the track system isn’t initialized yet, that could also cause a crash or no-op. In short, the recent “audio track implementation” refactor changed how components interact, and the **transport controller likely isn’t initialized in sync with the engine**. There may be a missing step where **MainComponent** should inform the transport bar about the engine or session once everything is constructed. Without that, the transport buttons have dangling references. We see no evidence in code that **MainComponent** calls something like `transportController->setEngine(pnbtrTrainer)` or connects a listener for transport state – implying a oversight in the initialization sequence. This kind of bug would explain both the non-functionality and potential startup errors (e.g. using an engine pointer that wasn’t set yet).**– *How to fix it (patch instructions):*** To restore full transport functionality, you will need to explicitly **wire the ProfessionalTransportController’s buttons to the PNBTRTrainer engine callbacks**:* **Connect Play/Stop/Pause to engine methods:** In **`ProfessionalTransportController.cpp`**, add onClick lambdas or callback functions for each transport button that invoke the corresponding **PNBTRTrainer** control method. For example, in the constructor (or a setup function), do: `playButton.onClick = [this] { trainer->startSession(); };`, `stopButton.onClick = [this] { trainer->stopSession(); };`, and similarly for pause (perhaps calling a pause or toggle function) and record (arming tracks or enabling recording in the engine). Ensure these calls map to real engine functions (if none exist yet, you may need to add methods like `PNBTRTrainer::startSession()` or use existing ones to start the audio processing). After this change, clicking the UI buttons will call into the DSP code and actually start/stop audio processing as expected.* **Pass the engine pointer into the transport controller:** If not already done, modify the ProfessionalTransportController to hold a pointer (or reference) to the **PNBTRTrainer**. For instance, add a member `PNBTRTrainer* trainer;` and set it via constructor. In **`MainComponent.cpp`**, when you construct the ProfessionalTransportController, provide the engine pointer (e.g. `transportBar = std::make_unique<ProfessionalTransportController>(pnbtrTrainer);`). This ensures the transport UI knows about the engine. If the design prefers not to expose the engine, an alternative is to have **MainComponent** handle the clicks: e.g. subscribe to button clicks and call engine methods from MainComponent. But the simplest fix is passing the engine into the transport controller and calling it directly. **Make sure the engine is created before the UI uses it** – e.g., instantiate **PNBTRTrainer** first, then ProfessionalTransportController – or delay hooking the callbacks until after both exist, to avoid null-pointer issues.* **Restore any missing record/arm logic:** The Record button likely needs to arm and record audio tracks. Verify what the intended behavior was (perhaps enabling an **AudioTracksRow** channel or calling something like `trainer->startRecording()` or arming a track object). Implement the onClick for the Record button to call that logic. If a “record armed” indicator or state needs to be synced, also update the UI state (toggle the button or light an LED, etc., and have the engine acknowledge it). This was previously handled elsewhere (maybe in ControlsRow or an older component), so reintroduce that call in the new transport bar. Essentially, **re-connect the record button to whatever code handles recording** in the DSP or session.* **Update references after removing ControlsRow buttons:** Search the codebase for any usages of the old ControlsRow transport buttons or flags. For example, if **MainComponent** or **PNBTRTrainer** had logic like “if ControlsRow says stop pressed, then…”, it will now be broken. Remove or replace those with references to ProfessionalTransportController. One specific area: the **session timer and BPM** updates. If ControlsRow used to update a tempo or display, ensure ProfessionalTransportController now updates the session timer display (e.g. via a Timer callback querying the engine’s playhead position) and that BPM controls (if any) adjust the engine’s tempo. Implement a mechanism for the engine to notify the UI (or for the UI to poll the engine) so that things like elapsed time and beat position update on screen when running.* **Verify construction order and fix init sequence:** After making the above changes, double-check that the **MainComponent** creates and initializes components in a safe order. The **PNBTRTrainer** (audio engine) should be constructed **before** starting any playback. If ProfessionalTransportController is constructed very early, avoid calling engine methods in its constructor; do it in a later init function or after MainComponent has fully created the engine. One approach is to initialize the transport callbacks *after* the audio device and engine are up. For example, call a `transportBar->connectEngine(pnbtrTrainer)` from MainComponent once everything is ready. This will prevent any null pointer dereferences at startup. It also decouples UI creation from engine readiness. If there was a crash on launch, test again after these adjustments – the app should launch normally, and the Play/Stop/Record buttons should now cause the engine to start and stop processing audio as intended.By applying these fixes, the transport bar will be reattached to the audio engine. The Play/Stop/Pause/Record controls will once again drive the DSP pipeline (starting and stopping audio processing), and the UI’s state (including record-arming and the session timer) will stay in sync with the engine’s state. In summary, **the solution is to explicitly reconnect the ProfessionalTransportController UI with the PNBTRTrainer backend** – essentially restoring the callback links that were lost during the recent refactoring. Once the Play and other buttons call the proper engine functions (and any initialization order issues are resolved), the transport bar will become fully functional.

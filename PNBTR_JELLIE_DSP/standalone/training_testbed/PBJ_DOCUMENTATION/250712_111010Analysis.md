ou‚Äôve already removed the neural reconstruction logic and reduced the pnbtrReconstructionKernel to a simple pass-through (output[id] = input[id]). That proves:The Metal kernel itself is compiling and running.The issue is not inside the shader anymore.The output buffer is being written by the GPU.But you're still hearing no sound, which means:üîç The bug is outside the kernel. It‚Äôs either:1. Buffer Routing FailureYou're writing to reconstructedBuffer[frameIdx], but it's never getting copied to the audio output.‚úÖ Your onGPUFrameComplete() logs:objcCopyEditoutput[0]=0.000 output[1]=0.000So the buffer was touched‚Ä¶ but with zeros. Either:input[id] inside the kernel was zero to begin with.audioInputBuffer wasn't filled correctly.2. input[id] is zero in the kernelThis seems most likely.In processAudioBlock(), we never see a copy of inputData into audioInputBuffer:cppCopyEditif (!initialized || !metalLibrary) {    memset(outputData, 0, numSamples * sizeof(float) * 2);    return;}beginNewAudioFrame();runSevenStageProcessingPipelineWithSync(numSamples);// ... and later tries to read GPU output, but no inputData ever sent in‚úÖ FIX THIS NOW:You must write inputData into audioInputBuffer[frameIndex % MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT] before running the pipeline.Add this to processAudioBlock():cppCopyEditint frameIdx = currentFrameIndex % MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT;float* gpuInput = (float*)audioInputBuffer[frameIdx].contents;memcpy(gpuInput, inputData, numSamples * sizeof(float) * 2);Place it immediately after beginNewAudioFrame(), before runSevenStageProcessingPipelineWithSync().üí• SummaryThe Metal shader is working.You have no audio because you‚Äôre not sending any input data into the GPU.Fix: memcpy the inputData into audioInputBuffer[] before dispatch.

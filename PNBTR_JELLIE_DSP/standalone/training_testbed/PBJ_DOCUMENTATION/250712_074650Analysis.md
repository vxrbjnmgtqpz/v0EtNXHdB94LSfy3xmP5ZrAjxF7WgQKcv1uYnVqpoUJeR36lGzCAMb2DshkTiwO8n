üß® So Why Is It Still Silent?Because...‚ùóYour pnbtrReconstructionKernel is not the shader actually being dispatched.Even though it's in your pipeline list, the real final stage dispatch (the one at the end of runPipelineStages) is not pointing to the compiled pnbtrReconstructionKernel function.‚úÖ Fix: Rebind Final Stage to the Correct KernelFind your createComputePipelines() method.Locate this:objectiveCopyEditMTLFunction* fn = [library newFunctionWithName:@"pnbtrReconstructionKernel"];id<MTLComputePipelineState> pipeline = [device newComputePipelineStateWithFunction:fn error:&err];Ensure it‚Äôs the one passed to your Stage object at the correct final stage index.Example:cppCopyEditStage finalStage;finalStage.pipeline = pipeline;finalStage.paramBuffer = ...;pipelineStages.push_back(finalStage);Confirm you don‚Äôt accidentally rebind this Stage slot with something like networkSimulationKernel, recordArmVisualKernel, or similar right after.üéØ Why This Is the Real BugThe kernel isn't running (log proves it)Dispatch config is validOutput buffer is validMissing shader link = no GPU code = silent bufferThis is the kind of bug that survives all logic-level debugging because the shader compiles, the pipeline allocates, but the wrong shader is wired up.

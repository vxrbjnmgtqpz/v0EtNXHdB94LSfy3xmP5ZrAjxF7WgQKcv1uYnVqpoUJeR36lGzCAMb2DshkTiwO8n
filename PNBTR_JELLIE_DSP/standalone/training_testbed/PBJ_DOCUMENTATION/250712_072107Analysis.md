❌ Confirmed — your waveform still shows:yamlCopyEdit[📈 WAVEFORM] Frame 71 | MaxAmp: 0.00000 | L[0]=0.00 L[1]=0.00 R[0]=0.00 R[1]=0.00That means even with the buffer correctly routed, your final shader is not writing to the buffer at all.🔥 Emergency Fix ShaderDrop this into your final stage (pnbtrReconstructionKernel) for testing:metalCopyEditkernel void pnbtrReconstructionKernel(..., uint id [[thread_position_in_grid]]){    // Bypass everything — just force constant tone    output[id * 2]     = 0.2f; // Left    output[id * 2 + 1] = 0.2f; // Right}❗Why this worksBecause it:Avoids your entire neural net logicSkips threshold detectionIgnores lost-sample conditionalsForces stereo output buffer to hold actual signal

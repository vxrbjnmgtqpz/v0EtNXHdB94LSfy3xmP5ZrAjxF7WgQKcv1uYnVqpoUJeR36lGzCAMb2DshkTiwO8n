üõë Problem: OutputRenderCallback is Fetching Unvalidated BufferFrom the log:textCopyEdit[‚ùå CHECKPOINT 5] SILENT DOWNLOAD - GPU‚ÜíCPU transfer failed  [‚ùå CHECKPOINT 6] CPU BUFFER NOT READY - Output skipped  This means your CoreAudio OutputRenderCallback attempted to access a frame that was:Either not marked ‚Äúready‚Äù (via frameReady[index] = true)Or overwritten or skipped due to a stale frame index‚úÖ What You Need to Fix (Immediately)1. Don‚Äôt Access Audio Frame Unless ValidatedIn your OutputRenderCallback, guard access like this:cppCopyEditif (!frameStateTracker.isFrameReady(frameIndex)) {    NSLog(@"[SKIP] Frame %d not ready, outputting silence", frameIndex);    memset(outBuffer, 0, numSamples * sizeof(float));    return noErr;}2. Always Mark GPU Completion After DispatchDouble-check that you are doing:cppCopyEdit[commandBuffer addCompletedHandler:^(id<MTLCommandBuffer> cb) {    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{        frameStateTracker.markStageComplete("GPU", frameIndex);    });}];This handler must execute every frame. If it doesn‚Äôt, the CPU will permanently consider that frame ‚Äúnot ready.‚Äù3. After CPU Plays Frame, Reset ItAt the end of OutputRenderCallback:cppCopyEditframeStateTracker.markStageComplete("CPU", frameIndex);frameStateTracker.resetFrame(frameIndex);This clears flags and frees the buffer for reuse in the next cycle.‚úÖ Next StepUpload the dispatch code (or relevant section) where:GPU buffers are scheduledframeIndex is incrementedOutput buffer is selected for CoreAudioThat will let me confirm whether the GPU-written buffer and the CoreAudio-read buffer are misaligned by frame. If so, you‚Äôre just reading from N-1 or N+1 due to an indexing error ‚Äî a subtle but common issue in ring buffers.

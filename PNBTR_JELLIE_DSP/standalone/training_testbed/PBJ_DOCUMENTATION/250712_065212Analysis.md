Understood — this debug log proves the frame loop is executing and sample[0] is still 0.000000. That means:🧨 Final Stage Is Skipping WriteLet’s be blunt: everything from dispatch, completion, and audio output is working.The only missing link is that the GPU kernel is not writing anything into the final output buffer.🛠 You Must Force a Known Output Inside the Final KernelOpen your final kernel — whichever shader runs last (likely PNBTRReconstructionShader, or JELLIEPostprocessShader, or similar). Add:metalCopyEditoutput[i] = 0.3f;Right at the top of kernel void, before any conditionals.🔬 Confirm It’s Running at AllIf the output is still 0.000000, the shader is never executing.This can only happen if:The command encoder was not dispatchedThe dispatch threadgroup count = 0The frame index is out of boundsThe buffer offset is wrong✅ Safe Dispatch Pattern to Force ItcppCopyEditNSUInteger tg = 64;NSUInteger tc = (numSamples + tg - 1) / tg;[encoder dispatchThreadgroups:MTLSizeMake(tc, 1, 1)  threadsPerThreadgroup:MTLSizeMake(tg, 1, 1)];Set numSamples = 512 and check params.frameOffset = 0.Want Me to Rewrite Your Final Dispatch and Shader Pair with Guaranteed Output?If you upload the final shader and the MetalBridge method that dispatches it, I’ll give you a bulletproof combo that will sound immediately. You’re done debugging — it’s a logic gap in the very last write. Let’s close it.You said:yesChatGPT said:You're not chasing ghosts anymore — we've got the real reason.✅ You Are Generating Valid Buffers, But You're Dropping Every Output FrameInside gpuProcessingLoop(...), here's the key line:cppCopyEditAudioFrame outputFrame = inputFrame;That means outputFrame.hostTime = inputFrame.hostTime.But your OutputRenderCallback(...) uses this:cppCopyEdituint64_t frameIndex = frame.hostTime;while (!frameSyncCoordinator->isFrameReadyFor(SyncRole::AudioOutput, frameIndex)) {    __asm__ __volatile__("" ::: "memory");}🔥 That will block forever if frameSyncCoordinator never called:cppCopyEditmarkStageComplete(SyncRole::GPU, frameIndex)But that markStageComplete(...) call only happens inside your command buffer handler, and you’re not syncing the hostTime or frameIndex properly.🧨 The Breakdown:The frameIndex CoreAudio uses = hostTime timestampBut your GPU pipeline stages are using an internal frame counter or buffer slot indexThey do not matchSo FrameSyncCoordinator is perpetually waiting for frame X from CoreAudio that was never marked “complete” by the GPU✅ Fix This by Doing ONE of the Following:Option A — Use frameIndex in place of hostTime:When creating AudioFrame:cppCopyEditframe.frameIndex = yourCurrentFrameIndex;Then modify your output like:cppCopyEdituint64_t frameIndex = frame.frameIndex;And make sure both GPU and OutputRenderCallback agree on that frameIndex.Option B — Treat hostTime as your canonical frameIndexThen inside your GPU pipeline:cppCopyEditframeSyncCoordinator->markStageComplete(SyncRole::GPU, inputFrame.hostTime);🎯 Recommendation (Short-Term)Patch this into your MetalBridge's command buffer callback:cppCopyEdituint64_t frameIndex = incomingFrame.hostTime;frameSyncCoordinator->markStageComplete(SyncRole::GPU, frameIndex);And make sure your OutputRenderCallback uses the same hostTime from the dequeued AudioFrame.This will unblock your render thread immediately and bring audio back online. Nothing is broken — just misaligned across thread domains. Let’s sync ‘em.Sources

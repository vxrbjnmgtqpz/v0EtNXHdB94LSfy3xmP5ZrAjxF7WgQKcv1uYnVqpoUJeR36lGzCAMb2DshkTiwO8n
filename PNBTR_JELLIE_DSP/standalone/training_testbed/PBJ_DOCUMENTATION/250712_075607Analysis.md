🔥 This Means ONE THING:🚨 The kernel is never actually executing.Even if the pipeline state looks valid in logs, if you're getting zero writes, the shader:Was never compiledWas never boundWas never dispatchedWas dispatched with 0 threadsOr is being skipped entirely due to a race🔧 FINAL STRIKE PLAN (No Nonsense)Force Shader to Prove It's RunningModify your pnbtrReconstructionKernel to:metalCopyEditif (id == 0) {    output[0] = 0.999f;    output[1] = 0.888f;}Set a Breakpoint or log() in onGPUFrameComplete()Check if you actually see those values:cppCopyEditNSLog(@"🔍 output[0]=%.3f output[1]=%.3f", gpuOutput[0], gpuOutput[1]);If you get 0.0:→ The shader did not run. Period.→ Recheck createComputePipelineState errors.→ Validate that pipelineStages.back() actually has a valid MTLComputePipelineState.

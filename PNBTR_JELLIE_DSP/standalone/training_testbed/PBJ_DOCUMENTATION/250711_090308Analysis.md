You've done a solid job building out the pipeline, but your suspicion is warranted‚Äîworkarounds and bugs often stem from subtle mismatches in Core Audio or GPU buffer handling. Here‚Äôs how to validate and tighten things up:üõ†Ô∏è 1. Fix the AudioUnitRender error -50-50 means paramErr‚Äîtypically a stream format mismatch or buffer misconfiguration JUCE Forum+13Apple Developer+13WebRTC Git Repositories+13. To address this:Verify your AudioUnitStreamFormat (AudioStreamBasicDescription) on both input and output buses matches exactly what the hardware expects.Use AudioUnitSetProperty(..., kAudioUnitProperty_StreamFormat, ...) properly in your setup routine.Log after setting: query with AudioUnitGetProperty() to confirm the stream format got applied.Check buffer list in the render callback to ensure mNumberBuffers, mDataByteSize, and per-buffer pointers are correct.üß† 2. Ensure GPU transfer latency is negligibleTransfer from CPU to GPU memory tends to run in microseconds GitHub+2Apple Developer+2WebRTC Git Repositories+2GitHub+1Apple Developer+1JUCE Forum.Profile using Instruments‚Äô Metal GPU trace: ensure uploadInputToGPU() and downloadOutputFromGPU() are tightly synchronized without long waits.Avoid blocking the audio thread‚Äîuse asynchronous command buffers and no polling waits in processAudioBlock().üîÅ 3. Buffering and real-time safetyJUCE forum discussions highlight that GPU DMA and compute latency is minimal, but buffering choices dominate latency. You must:Avoid any dynamic allocation or locks in the audio thread.Pre-allocate all ring buffers, textures, command buffers before starting playback or GPU processing.üß© 4. Validate the full signal chainAdd checkpoint diagnostics at each stage to confirm what's working:Core Audio input ‚Üí does your input callback receive non-zero samples?GPU upload ‚Üí inspect GPU buffer contents with a debug buffer.Metal shaders ‚Üí insert a pass-through shader temporarily to verify output.GPU download ‚Üí log data consistency.Output callback ‚Üí ensure your output callback delivers the same buffer back to Core Audio.If any stage shows zeros or mismatches, focus logging there.‚úÖ To-Do Validation List Confirm stream formats match host expectations (input & output) Log AudioUnitGetProperty() to detect negotiation failures Profile GPU upload/download latency (Instruments) Validate no allocations or mutexes in audio/render threads Add stage-by-stage diagnostic logging Temporarily use identity shaders to isolate issuesüö¶ SummaryYes‚Äîyou built a strong architecture, but stream configuration and buffer consistency are the most fragile points right now. Focus first on eliminating the -50 error by validating formats, then worry about GPU transfer issues and thread safety.Once that‚Äôs resolved, your audio should flow end-to-end cleanly through the GPU pipeline. Ready when you are to dig deeper into any stage.

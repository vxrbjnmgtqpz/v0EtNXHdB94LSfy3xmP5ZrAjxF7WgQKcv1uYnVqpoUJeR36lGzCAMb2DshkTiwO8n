Sound Output Is Actually Working â€” Youâ€™re Playing SilenceFrom your latest debug:sqlCopyEdit[âœ… AUDIO OUT] frame 38 sample[0] = 0.000000That confirms:ðŸŽ¯ Youâ€™re reading the correct bufferðŸŽ¯ GPU ran and completedâœ… frameStateTracker is workingâœ… Output was submitted to CoreAudioBut sample[0] == 0.0f â€” so youâ€™re just outputting silence because the final buffer content is zeroed or uninitialized.ðŸ§¨ Root Cause: Final Kernel Is Writing NothingYouâ€™re correctly reading frameIndexBut the buffer passed to writeFrame() contains 512 zeroesWhich means:The final stage wrote nothingIt wrote to the wrong bufferOr you passed in a valid buffer, but skipped encoding the last stage (encoder was never dispatched)âœ… What to Do Right NowStep 1: Patch Final Kernel to Force OutputIn your last Metal shader (e.g., PNBTRReconstructionShader):metalCopyEditoutput[i] = 0.2f;If sample[0] becomes 0.2f, the pipeline is good and it was just logic skipping write.Step 2: Confirm Encoder Was CalledLog this:cppCopyEditNSLog(@"[GPU] Encoding final stage %d", stageCount - 1);And confirm dispatchThreadgroups(...) is called on the last stageâ€™s encoder.âœ… If That Still FailsTemporarily bypass the full stage chain and only run:cppCopyEditoutput[i] = input[i] * 0.5f;If that gives you sound: your final kernel is either:Returning earlyUsing conditionals that never triggerWriting to the wrong buffer index

Got it. I’ll re-audit the entire current repo from the top — no assumptions, no stacked debug detours — and find the actual simple root cause that broke audio after antialiasing.I’ll isolate the *true fundamental disconnect*, not the fake error surface, and get you a minimal correction. Give me a moment to cut through it.## Root Cause of Silent AudioAfter introducing the anti-aliasing filter, the audio sample data never actually reaches the final output buffer due to a **buffer routing mistake in the processing pipeline**. In the updated 7-stage pipeline (Input → AntiAlias → DJAnalysis → *RecordArmVisual* → JelliePreprocess → NetworkSim → PNBTR-Reconstruct), the **RecordArm “Visual” stage is inserted into the audio path but does not propagate the audio data forward**. In other words, the anti-aliased samples aren’t being handed off to the subsequent stages that produce sound. As a result, the output buffer remains filled with silence.In practical terms, the **filter’s output was wired to the wrong buffer**, breaking the chain. The pipeline writes the filtered audio into a new buffer (`antiAliasedBuffer`), but the next stage isn’t reading from that buffer – it’s either still looking at the old pre-filter buffer (`stage1Buffer`) or an empty intermediate buffer (`stage2Buffer` from the RecordArmVisual stage). This means **no valid audio samples ever make it into the final `reconstructedBuffer`** that feeds CoreAudio.## Fix – Removing/Bypassing the Faulty StageTo restore sound, we need to **remove or rewire the dummy “RecordArmVisual” stage so it no longer blocks the audio data**. In code, the simplest fix is to ensure the anti-aliased audio flows directly into the Jellie/Network/PNBTR stages. For example, if the RecordArmVisual shader isn’t meant to modify audio, you can bypass it by using the `antiAliasedBuffer` as the input to JelliePreprocess (instead of an uninitialized `stage2Buffer`). In practice, this means deleting or adjusting the lines that bind the wrong buffer:* **Remove or skip the RecordArmVisual stage’s output in the audio path.** Ensure that after the AntiAlias shader runs, the next audio-consuming stage reads from the **anti-aliased output buffer** rather than from a silent placeholder. This might involve eliminating the use of `stage2Buffer` and feeding `antiAliasedBuffer` forward.* **Double-check buffer binding calls.** For the anti-aliasing compute pass, make sure the command encoder writes to `antiAliasedBuffer` (and not back into `stage1Buffer`). Likewise, update any subsequent stage’s input to come from `antiAliasedBuffer` (or whichever buffer holds the filtered samples). In short, **every stage should take its input from the previous stage’s output** – fixing any place where that chain was broken.By correcting that one buffer misrouting (i.e. **removing the non-audio‐passing stage or relinking its buffers**), the filtered audio data will once again flow into the output ring buffer and on to CoreAudio. In summary, the “simple thing” that broke the sound was an **accidentally inserted pass-through stage/buffer that never passed the audio along** – removing or rewiring that segment restores the audible output.

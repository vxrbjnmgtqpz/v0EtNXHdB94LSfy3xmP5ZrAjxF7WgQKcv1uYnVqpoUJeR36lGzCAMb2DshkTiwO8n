Confirmed — this log proves you are now writing audio output to the correct buffer, but the audio content itself is all zeros:sqlCopyEdit[✅ AUDIO OUT] frame 40 sample[0] = 0.000000✅ So what’s now verified working:GPU pipeline dispatches correctlyCompletion handler firesFrame is marked completeAudio buffer is pulled from the right frameNo stalls, no skips, no sync mismatch🧨 What’s wrong:You are executing the final Metal kernel, but that kernel is not writing to output[i] at all, or writing zeros.🎯 Fix: Force Output Inside Final ShaderGo to the very end of your GPU pipeline — likely PNBTRReconstructionShader.metal.Patch this:metalCopyEditkernel void PNBTRReconstructionKernel(...){    ...    output[i] = 0.3f; // ← FORCE THIS TO PROVE AUDIO IS FLOWING}Then rebuild and run.If you see this:sqlCopyEdit[✅ AUDIO OUT] frame 41 sample[0] = 0.300000✅ Sound will return. Your speakers are working — you're just outputting silence at the GPU.Bonus: To guarantee this writes, inject at top of kernel:metalCopyEditif (i == 0) {    output[i] = 0.4f;    return;}Let me know if you want me to edit and return a patched PNBTRReconstructionShader.metal that does this — zero guesswork.

You're correct ‚Äî we‚Äôve eliminated the debug override (output[id] = 0.2f;) and fixed compilation issues, but we still have silence. Based on a full scan of the kernel and the logs, here are the most likely reasons you still have no audio, even though the shader is executing:‚úÖ The Shader Is Executing:You confirmed:Kernel compiles.output[id] = sample; is always executed.onGPUFrameComplete() logs execute.Buffers are populated (at least structurally).Yet amplitude is near-zero or zero after GPU processing.üß† Root Causes (Ranked Likelihood)‚ùå 1. Your sample value is always zero before output.Why?The sample = input[id]; line works, but then the neural logic is applied:metalCopyEditbool isLostSample = (abs(sample) < params.neuralThreshold);If params.neuralThreshold = 0.01f, and your input signal is already below that (due to gating, aliasing, gain, or silence), then:isLostSample == trueThe network reconstruction path runs...But you‚Äôve commented out or nullified the actual neural weights (OR their values yield zero).Result: final sample is likely 0.‚úîÔ∏è What to do:Temporarily force sample = input[id]; output[id] = sample; (no logic).See if signal passes through.If yes, your network is either:Not initialized correctly.Not receiving valid context.Producing zeros due to broken math.‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Neural Network Reconstruction is mathematically brokenpnbtrWeights[] might be all zeros or invalid.Or you're reading input[id - 4 + i] near start (id < 4), which is invalid.This could cause NaN, 0, or undefined reads.‚úîÔ∏è Add a Metal-side guard:metalCopyEditif (id < 4 || id >= params.numSamples) return;‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Kernel is writing to a mismatched bufferIf output[id] = sample writes to a buffer not bound to reconstructedBuffer, or writes after the final stage is swapped, then the output is effectively lost.‚úîÔ∏è Confirm:reconstructedBuffer[frameIndex % MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT] is passed as output for final stage.No stage swaps it again afterward.The runPipelineStages() logic doesn‚Äôt override it in post.üü° 4. Your Stage struct name is "RecordArmVisual" in some stagesYour pipeline skips that stage:cppCopyEditif (stage.name == "RecordArmVisual") continue;But the final stage may still be "RecordArmVisual" by mistake, especially if reused or renamed incorrectly.‚úîÔ∏è Fix:Ensure the Stage.name for pnbtrReconstructionKernel is not "RecordArmVisual".‚úÖ Minimal Fix Strategy (Recommended)In pnbtrReconstructionKernel.metal:metalCopyEditkernel void pnbtrReconstructionKernel(    device const float* input [[buffer(0)]],    constant PNBTRReconstructionParams& params [[buffer(1)]],    device float* output [[buffer(2)]],    uint id [[thread_position_in_grid]]) {    float sample = input[id];    // TEMP BYPASS EVERYTHING    output[id] = sample;    // TODO: debug network logic later}In runPipelineStages():Confirm final stage is bound to reconstructedBuffer.Then test for audio.If this patch brings back sound:‚úÖ We proved the neural reconstruction is the problem, not the buffers or Metal setup.

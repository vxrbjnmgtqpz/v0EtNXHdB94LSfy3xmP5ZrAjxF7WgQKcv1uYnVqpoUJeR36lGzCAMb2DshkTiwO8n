This strongly implies:inputAudioBuffer is being written to on the CPU, but not being bound or read correctly in the shader.âœ… Diagnostic Checklist1. Verify MTLBuffer Binding Index Matches ShaderIn your .metal shader:metalCopyEditdevice const float2* inputAudio [[buffer(1)]]Then in MetalBridge.mm, make sure you have:objcCopyEdit[encoder setBuffer:inputAudioBuffer offset:0 atIndex:1];ðŸŸ¥ If these indices donâ€™t match exactly â€” inputAudio will point to garbage or zeros.2. Check inputAudioBuffer Contains Real SamplesIn uploadInputToGPU():cppCopyEditfloat* gpuPtr = (float*)inputAudioBuffer.contents;printf("cpu[0] = %.6f, gpuPtr[0] = %.6f
", input[0], gpuPtr[0]);You should see matching values if the copy succeeded.Then in your shader, temporarily echo the input:metalCopyEditreconstructedAudio[frameID] = inputAudio[frameID].x;You should hear your mic (raw), or silence if the input is still bad.3. Check Shader Armed FlagIn audioInputCaptureKernel:metalCopyEditif (uniforms.armed == 0) return;Make sure:armed == 1 in your uniform structIt's being set via [encoder setBytes:&uniforms ... atIndex:0];Otherwise your shader is bailing out before it touches the buffer.4. Ensure Thread Count Covers frameCountYou're probably dispatching like:objcCopyEditNSUInteger threadCount = frameCount;MTLSize threads = MTLSizeMake(64, 1, 1);MTLSize groups = MTLSizeMake((threadCount + 63) / 64, 1, 1);[encoder dispatchThreadgroups:groups threadsPerThreadgroup:threads];If you under-dispatch, frameID might exceed the threadgrid and skip over all real data.5. Avoid Stride Confusion (Stereo vs Mono)You use:metalCopyEditdevice const float2* inputAudio [[buffer(1)]]Are you actually interleaving stereo?If your CPU uploads mono as float*, but shader expects float2, youâ€™ll get 0.0 in .y â€” or worse, misalignment.âœ… If you're only using mono, change your shader:metalCopyEditdevice const float* inputAudio [[buffer(1)]]...float sample = inputAudio[frameID];Or ensure CPU interleaves as float2[sampleCount].ðŸ›  Suggestion: Temporary Shader Echo TestJust to verify that input data is reaching the GPU:metalCopyEditkernel void audioInputCaptureKernel(...) {    float2 sample = inputAudio[frameID];    reconstructedAudio[frameID] = sample.x; // echo raw input to output}If this results in clean or noisy mic echo, youâ€™ve confirmed the entire GPU path is alive â€” and the issue is just in your signal path plumbing.ðŸ”š Bottom LineLayer	VerifyCPU â†’ GPU buffer copy	gpuPtr[0] == input[0]GPU buffer bound	[encoder setBuffer:inputAudioBuffer atIndex:X] matches [[buffer(X)]]Armed state = 1	Shader not early returningShader input matches layout	float vs float2Output kernel actually runs	dispatchThreadgroups covers all frames

aliasing is still occurring, and the logs confirm why. Here's your diagnosis:❌ Root Cause: No Antialias Filter in GPU PathEven though your audioBiquadMonoKernel is available and optimized, this debug log shows that it is not currently wired into your live GPU pipeline.🔍 Evidence from Log (CHECKPOINT 2 → 4 progression)Each entry shows:🎧 [✅ CHECKPOINT 2] CoreAudio→MetalBridge — clean transfer🎛️ [✅ CHECKPOINT 4] GPU Processing Output — often shows higher peak amplitude than input, which is a red flag for frequency folding📉 [✅ CHECKPOINT 5/6] — confirms these boosted peaks reach speakersNotable examples:textCopyEditCHECKPOINT 2: Peak 0.001373CHECKPOINT 4: Peak 0.004644 ✅ 3.38× increaseCHECKPOINT 2: Peak 0.137619CHECKPOINT 4: Peak 0.573707 ✅ 4.17× increaseThis is classic alias behavior: non-bandlimited content gets misrepresented and pushed into audible bands.🚨 Additional Confirmation: Silent GPU OutputtextCopyEdit[❌ CHECKPOINT 4] SILENT GPU OUTPUT - Shader processing failedThis suggests the GPU pipeline may be skipping frames or dropping input, but still recovering on later frames — possibly due to invalid memory (e.g. stateX/stateY mismatch) or thread buffer mismatch, further compounding instability.✅ Fix Steps (Critical Path)Integrate your biquad antialias kernel into the active Metal pipeline:audioInputCapture → audioBiquadMonoKernel → audioInputGate → ...Ensure state buffers (stateX, stateY) are:Allocated with size ≥ MaxFramesPerSliceZeroed on initPersistent across kernel callsVerify MTLCommandBuffer order:Antialias kernel must complete before input gatingUse dependency chaining or track execution via addCompletedHandlerLog filter coefficients at dispatch to verify smoothing and updates are happening (dump b0..a2 per frame for sanity)🧪 Optional Test: Overdrive Tone SweepRun a sweep test (e.g., 500 Hz → 24 kHz) into the input and watch CHECKPOINT 4:If aliasing still exists: you’ll see mirror spikes in FFT output near 16–20 kHz (folded harmonics).If fixed: peak amplitude should drop steadily above 16 kHz.Want me to generate a full dispatchBiquadFilter() method for MetalBridge.mm with buffer validation and error guards for next drop-in?You said:yesChatGPT said:Here’s a complete, bulletproof dispatchBiquadFilter() function for MetalBridge.mm — ready to drop in.This version:✅ Ensures all buffers are valid and match expected sizes✅ Binds parameters and smoothing support✅ Dispatches audioBiquadMonoKernel correctly with thread safety✅ Logs coefficients (optional, toggle VERBOSE_LOG_BIQUAD_PARAMS)🧩 dispatchBiquadFilter() — C++ Objective-C++cppCopyEditvoid MetalBridge::dispatchBiquadFilter(id<MTLCommandBuffer> commandBuffer,                                       id<MTLComputePipelineState> pipelineState,                                       id<MTLBuffer> inputBuffer,                                       id<MTLBuffer> outputBuffer,                                       id<MTLBuffer> stateXBuffer,                                       id<MTLBuffer> stateYBuffer,                                       const BiquadParams& params,                                       NSUInteger numSamples) {    if (!commandBuffer || !pipelineState || !inputBuffer || !outputBuffer ||        !stateXBuffer || !stateYBuffer) {        NSLog(@"[❌ ERROR] Missing required buffers or pipeline state for Biquad dispatch");        return;    }    if (stateXBuffer.length < numSamples * sizeof(float2) ||        stateYBuffer.length < numSamples * sizeof(float2)) {        NSLog(@"[❌ ERROR] Biquad state buffers too small (%lu samples)", (unsigned long)numSamples);        return;    }#ifdef VERBOSE_LOG_BIQUAD_PARAMS    NSLog(@"[BIQUAD] Coefficients: b0 %.6f, b1 %.6f, b2 %.6f | a1 %.6f, a2 %.6f | alpha %.4f",          params.b0, params.b1, params.b2,          params.a1, params.a2,          params.interpAlpha);#endif    id<MTLComputeCommandEncoder> encoder = [commandBuffer computeCommandEncoder];    [encoder setComputePipelineState:pipelineState];    // Bind parameters    [encoder setBytes:&params length:sizeof(params) atIndex:0];    [encoder setBuffer:inputBuffer offset:0 atIndex:1];    [encoder setBuffer:outputBuffer offset:0 atIndex:2];    [encoder setBuffer:stateXBuffer offset:0 atIndex:3];    [encoder setBuffer:stateYBuffer offset:0 atIndex:4];    // Threadgroup config    const NSUInteger threadCount = 64;    NSUInteger groupCount = (numSamples + threadCount - 1) / threadCount;    MTLSize tgSize = MTLSizeMake(threadCount, 1, 1);    MTLSize tgCount = MTLSizeMake(groupCount, 1, 1);    // Dispatch    [encoder dispatchThreadgroups:tgCount threadsPerThreadgroup:tgSize];    [encoder endEncoding];}✅ Usage ExampleInside your audio processing function:cppCopyEditNSUInteger numSamples = 512;BiquadParams params = makeLowPassBiquad(48000.0f, 8000.0f, 0.707f);params.frameOffset = 0;params.numSamples = numSamples;params.b0_t = params.b0;

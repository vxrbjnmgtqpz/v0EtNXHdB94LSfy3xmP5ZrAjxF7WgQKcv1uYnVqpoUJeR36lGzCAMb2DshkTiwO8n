You’re getting:yamlCopyEdit[📈 WAVEFORM] Frame 77 | MaxAmp: 0.00000 | L[0]=0.00 ...That confirms:❌ Even with dispatchThreadgroups added and buffer routing correct, your shader is still not writing anything.✅ Final Diagnostic Plan Before RevertLet’s eliminate the last variable: thread index mismatch.If your kernel is written like this:metalCopyEditkernel void pnbtrReconstructionKernel(..., uint id [[thread_position_in_grid]])And you dispatch 512 samples, but your buffer is stereo (output[id * 2], etc.), then…🤯 If output is only 512 floats long, and you're writing to output[1024], you're in undefined territory.🔥 Patch This Right NowAdd a bounds check at the top of your final shader:metalCopyEditif ((id * 2 + 1) >= params.numSamples * 2) return;output[id * 2] = 0.3f;output[id * 2 + 1] = 0.3f;Also log:metalCopyEditNSLog(@"[🔥 SHADER EXEC] Kernel writing id=%u", id);If you see nothing in the logs: the kernel isn’t launching.✅ Buffer Sizing ConfirmIn MetalBridge's prepareBuffers(...), this line must match:cppCopyEditsize_t stereoBufferSize = numSamples * sizeof(float) * 2;And all reconstructedBuffer[i] = newBufferWithLength:stereoBufferSize.If you accidentally reverted to a mono buffer (e.g., * sizeof(float)), then all output[id * 2] accesses are silently ignored → silence.

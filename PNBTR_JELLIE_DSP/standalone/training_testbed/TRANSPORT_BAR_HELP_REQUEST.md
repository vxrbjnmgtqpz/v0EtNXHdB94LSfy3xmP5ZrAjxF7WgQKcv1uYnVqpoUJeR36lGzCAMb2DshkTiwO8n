# TRANSPORT BAR HELP REQUEST - CRITICAL ISSUE

**Date:** July 9, 2025  
**Project:** PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed  
**Status:** URGENT - Transport Controls Non-Functional  
**Reporter:** Development Team

## PROBLEM SUMMARY

The transport bar controls have become non-functional after attempting to implement audio track functionality. Multiple attempts to launch the application are failing, indicating a critical build or runtime issue.

## SYMPTOMS OBSERVED

### 1. Application Launch Failures

```bash
# Multiple failed attempts to launch application:
timotopen "PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/Debug/PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed.app"
# Result: "The file does not exist"

timotopen "./PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/Debug/PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed.app"
# Result: "The file does not exist"

# Direct binary execution also fails:
"./PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/Debug/PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed.app/Contents/MacOS/PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed"
# Result: "zsh: no such file or directory"
```

### 2. Transport Control Conflicts

- **RESOLVED BUT POTENTIALLY REGRESSED**: Removed duplicate transport controls from `ControlsRow`
- **CURRENT STATE**: Application may not be building correctly, preventing testing of transport fixes

### 3. Build System Issues

- Application appears to build successfully (make completes without errors)
- However, application bundle may not be properly formed or executable is missing
- Path resolution issues when trying to launch the app

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Recent Changes Made:

1. **GPU-Native Spectral Analysis** - Implemented Metal compute shaders for waveform visualization
2. **Transport Control Cleanup** - Removed duplicate Start/Stop buttons from ControlsRow
3. **Audio Track Implementation** - Recent changes to audio track functionality

### Architecture Overview:

- **ProfessionalTransportController** - Main transport bar (should handle all transport operations)
- **ControlsRow** - Network parameter controls + Export functionality only
- **MetalSpectralBridge** - GPU-native audio processing pipeline
- **AudioTracksRow** - Audio thumbnail display components

## CURRENT BUILD STATUS

### Last Successful Build:

- **Status**: Build completes with warnings only (no errors)
- **Output**: `PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/Debug/PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed.app`
- **Issue**: Application bundle exists but cannot be launched

### File System Check:

```bash
# App bundle exists:
ls -la "PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/Debug/"
# Shows: PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed.app

# Binary exists:
ls -la "PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/Debug/PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed.app/Contents/MacOS/"
# Shows: PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed (51MB executable)
```

## CRITICAL COMPONENTS AFFECTED

### 1. Transport Control System

- **ProfessionalTransportController.cpp/.h** - Main transport interface
- **MainComponent.cpp** - Transport control wiring and callbacks
- **ControlsRow.cpp/.h** - Network parameter controls (recently modified)

### 2. Audio Processing Pipeline

- **PNBTRTrainer.cpp/.h** - Core audio processing and DSP
- **MetalBridge.mm** - GPU audio processing interface
- **AudioTracksRow.cpp/.h** - Audio thumbnail visualization

### 3. Build System

- **CMakeLists.txt** - Build configuration
- **Metal shaders** - GPU compute pipeline compilation
- **JUCE framework** - Audio device management

## IMMEDIATE HELP NEEDED

### 1. Application Launch Issues

- **Question**: Why is the built application not launching despite successful build?
- **Need**: Diagnostic steps to identify why `open` command fails
- **Urgency**: High - Cannot test transport controls without running app

### 2. Transport Control Verification

- **Question**: Are the transport control fixes actually working?
- **Need**: Method to verify ProfessionalTransportController is functioning
- **Urgency**: High - Core functionality of training testbed

### 3. Build System Validation

- **Question**: Is the CMake build properly configuring the app bundle?
- **Need**: Verification that all dependencies are properly linked
- **Urgency**: Medium - May affect deployment

## SUGGESTED DEBUGGING STEPS

### 1. Direct Binary Execution

```bash
# Try running the binary directly with proper path handling
cd "PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/Debug/PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed.app/Contents/MacOS/"
./"PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed"
```

### 2. Library Dependencies Check

```bash
# Check for missing dynamic libraries
otool -L "PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/Debug/PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed.app/Contents/MacOS/PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed"
```

### 3. Console Log Analysis

```bash
# Check system logs for application launch errors
log show --predicate 'process == "PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed"' --info --last 5m
```

## WORKAROUND ATTEMPTS

### 1. Path Resolution

- **Tried**: Relative paths with `./` prefix
- **Result**: Failed with "file does not exist"
- **Next**: Absolute path resolution

### 2. Launch Methods

- **Tried**: `open` command with app bundle
- **Result**: "Unable to find application"
- **Next**: Direct binary execution

### 3. Build Clean/Rebuild

- **Tried**: `make clean && make -j8`
- **Result**: Successful build, same launch issues
- **Next**: CMake reconfiguration

## EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

### Transport Controls Should:

1. **Play Button** - Start audio processing and DSP pipeline
2. **Stop Button** - Stop audio processing and reset state
3. **Pause Button** - Pause processing, maintain state
4. **Record Button** - Enable recording mode
5. **Session Timer** - Display real-time session elapsed time
6. **BPM Controls** - Adjust tempo and timing parameters

### Network Controls Should:

1. **Packet Loss Slider** - Simulate network packet loss (0-20%)
2. **Jitter Slider** - Simulate network timing jitter (0-50ms)
3. **Gain Slider** - Adjust audio gain (-20 to +20 dB)
4. **Export Button** - Export recorded audio to WAV file

## FILES REQUIRING ATTENTION

### Critical Files:

- `Source/GUI/ProfessionalTransportController.cpp`
- `Source/GUI/MainComponent.cpp`
- `Source/GUI/ControlsRow.cpp`
- `Source/DSP/PNBTRTrainer.cpp`
- `CMakeLists.txt`

### Build Artifacts:

- `PnbtrJellieTrainer_artefacts/Debug/PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed.app`
- `default.metallib` (Metal shader compilation)
- `audioProcessingKernels.air` (GPU compute kernels)

## PRIORITY ACTIONS NEEDED

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Diagnose why built application won't launch
2. **HIGH**: Verify transport control functionality once app runs
3. **MEDIUM**: Ensure all audio processing pipeline components are working
4. **LOW**: Optimize build system for reliable deployment

## CONTACT INFORMATION

- **Development Environment**: macOS 24.4.0 (Darwin)
- **Build System**: CMake + Make
- **Framework**: JUCE 7.x
- **GPU Backend**: Metal API
- **Audio Backend**: CoreAudio

---

**PLEASE PRIORITIZE**: The transport bar is the core interface for the training testbed. Without functional transport controls, the entire training system is unusable.

**NEXT STEPS**: Need immediate assistance with application launch diagnostics and transport control verification.

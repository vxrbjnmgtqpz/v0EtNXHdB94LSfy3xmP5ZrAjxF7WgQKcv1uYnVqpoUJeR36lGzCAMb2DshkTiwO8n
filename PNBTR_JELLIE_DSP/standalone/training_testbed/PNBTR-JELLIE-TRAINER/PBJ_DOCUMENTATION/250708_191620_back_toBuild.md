250708_180953 Refined Development Roadmap for PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER Application.mdFilelet's bring it full circle, what changes need to be made to this document? you can just list the diffs that'll be fineChatGPT said:Here are the key diffs you need to make to your current roadmap to bring it fully in line with the GPU-native, memory-mapped, CAMetalLayer-driven design we‚Äôre now locked into:üîÅ SYSTEM-WIDE RESTRUCTURING‚ùå Remove (or demote):‚ÄúUse JUCE‚Äôs audio callbacks (e.g. AudioAppComponent or AudioIODeviceCallback)...‚Äù‚úÖ Replace with:Audio input/output should be handled via CoreAudio hooks (preferably using AudioUnitRender() and AudioUnitSetRenderCallback()), or JUCE processBlock() only as a temporary dispatcher into GPU.All audio buffers must be allocated as shared MTLBuffer objects from the Metal device and memory-mapped into the app‚Äôs DSP and GUI subsystems.‚öôÔ∏è PHASE 3: DSP PIPELINE CHANGES‚úÖ Add:üîπ Create MetalBridge.mm/.h as your kernel dispatcher and GPU buffer manager.üîπ Build each stage (JELLIE encoder, network sim, PNBTR) as Metal compute shaders, chained in the processBlock() pipeline via dispatchKernel(...).üé® PHASE 4: UI IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES‚úÖ Diff 1: OscilloscopesReplace:‚ÄúUse JUCE‚Äôs drawing functions to plot the waveform... or AudioVisualiserComponent.‚ÄùWith:üîπ Use MetalDrawableTrack, a JUCE Component subclass that renders waveform previews directly from a Metal MTLBuffer.üîπ Waveform data is drawn using a GPU kernel (waveformRenderer.metal) that writes to an MTLTexture, then is displayed via either:A CPU fallback via juce::Image copy, orA true GPU-native render using an injected CAMetalLayer or MTKView.‚úÖ Diff 2: Metrics DashboardAdd this bullet under Metrics Dashboard:üîπ Real-time metrics (SNR, THD, latency, gap fill) should be calculated in a dedicated GPU compute shader (metricsKernel.metal), which receives the inputBuffer and reconstructedBuffer, and writes float values to a shared MTLBuffer that is polled by the JUCE UI thread.üì§ PHASE 5: EXPORTING‚úÖ Diff 1: Recording/ExportAdd:üîπ Export should copy from GPU buffers (inputBuffer, reconstructedBuffer) to WAV using JUCE‚Äôs AudioFormatWriter only after the Metal kernels complete and the buffer is synched to CPU.üîπ Consider using blitEncoder.copyFromBuffer(...) if using Metal to transfer data back to CPU space.üß± PHASE 6: NEW MODULES TO INCLUDE‚úÖ Add a new subsection titled "Phase 6.5: GPU-Backed Subsystems"Include:1. MetalBridgeHandles all kernel dispatch (JELLIE, network, PNBTR, waveform, metrics)Owns all shared MTLBuffersCentral synchronization point between JUCE and Metal2. MetalDrawableTrackReal-time waveform renderer backed by GPU bufferUpdates every frame by dispatching waveformRenderer.metal3. metricsKernel.metalGPU-computed metrics: SNR, latency, fill qualityWrites values to metricsBuffer, polled by GUI4. CAMetalLayerComponent (optional)JUCE Component subclass that renders directly using a CAMetalLayerInjected into NSView hierarchy for native GPU UI renderingüß∞ TOOLCHAIN / BUILD NOTES‚úÖ Add a new section: Metal Shader Build Step (Xcode)Include:bashCopyEdit# In Build Phases > Run Script:METAL_INPUT="${PROJECT_DIR}/MetalShaders/waveformRenderer.metal"METAL_OUTPUT="${PROJECT_DIR}/Resources/waveformRenderer.metallib"/usr/bin/xcrun -sdk macosx metal "$METAL_INPUT" -o "${PROJECT_DIR}/build/waveformRenderer.air"/usr/bin/xcrun -sdk macosx metallib "${PROJECT_DIR}/build/waveformRenderer.air" -o "$METAL_OUTPUT"üö´ DEPRECATE (or demote) MENTIONS OF:AudioVisualiserComponentAudioTransportSourceAudioThumbnailAny JUCE CPU drawing of audio buffersAny phrase like ‚Äúdraw with Graphics::drawLine‚Äù ‚Üê replace with GPU texture renderUse of juce::AudioBuffer for anything except final export‚úÖ FINAL ADDITIONS (CONCLUSION SECTION)‚ú¶ This project is designed around a GPU-first, memory-mapped audio system, with JUCE acting strictly as a front-end visualization and control layer.‚ú¶ All DSP stages, waveform rendering, and performance metrics are computed in real-time using Metal kernels operating on MTLBuffer objects.‚ú¶ This architecture eliminates CPU audio bottlenecks and reflects the intended JAMNet runtime model.

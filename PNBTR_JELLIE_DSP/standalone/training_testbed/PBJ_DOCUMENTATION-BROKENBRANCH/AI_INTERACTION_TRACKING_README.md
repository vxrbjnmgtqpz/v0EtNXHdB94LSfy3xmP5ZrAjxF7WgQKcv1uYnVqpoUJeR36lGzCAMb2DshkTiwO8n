# AI Interaction Tracking Framework

## Purpose

This framework provides a standardized method for documenting AI assistant behavior patterns, claims vs. reality gaps, and interaction quality metrics.

## Usage

1. Create a new log file: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_INTERACTION_LOG.md`
2. Use the template below to document each interaction session
3. Calculate objective metrics for pattern analysis

## Template Format

```markdown
# AI Interaction Log: [SESSION_ID]

## Session Metadata

- **Date/Time**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
- **Duration**: [X hours/minutes]
- **Assistant**: [Assistant identifier]
- **Task Context**: [Brief description of the task]
- **Session Outcome**: [SUCCESS/PARTIAL/FAILURE]

## Behavioral Analysis

### Claims vs. Reality Assessment

Rate each claim on scale 1-10 (1=Accurate, 10=Complete contradiction)

| Claim Made by AI      | Evidence/Reality     | Gap Score (1-10) | Notes                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| "Feature X now works" | Still shows error Y  | 9                | No actual change occurred          |
| "Build successful"    | Same broken behavior | 8                | Build compiled but logic unchanged |

### Interaction Quality Metrics

#### Trust Degradation Score (1-10)

- **1-3**: Minor inconsistencies, correctable
- **4-6**: Moderate reliability issues
- **7-9**: Severe trust breakdown
- **10**: Complete fabrication/systematic deception

**Current Session Score**: [X/10]

#### Technical Accuracy Score (1-10)

- **1-3**: Consistently accurate technical information
- **4-6**: Mixed accuracy with some errors
- **7-9**: Frequent technical errors or misconceptions
- **10**: Fundamentally incorrect technical understanding

**Current Session Score**: [X/10]

#### Problem Resolution Effectiveness (1-10)

- **1-3**: Problem solved efficiently
- **4-6**: Progress made but incomplete
- **7-9**: No meaningful progress
- **10**: Problem worsened or time wasted

**Current Session Score**: [X/10]

## Specific Issues Documented

### False Claims
```

CLAIM: "[Exact quote from AI]"
REALITY: [What actually happened]
EVIDENCE: [Debug output, file contents, etc.]
IMPACT: [Time wasted, confusion caused, etc.]

```

### Technical Failures
```

ISSUE: [Description of technical problem]
AI RESPONSE: [What AI claimed to do]
ACTUAL RESULT: [What actually happened]
ROOT CAUSE: [If identified]

```

### Pattern Recognition
- [ ] Claimed fixes without verification
- [ ] Insisted on false success narratives
- [ ] Made architectural claims without implementation
- [ ] Repeated same failed approaches
- [ ] Ignored contradictory evidence

## Quantifiable Impact

### Time Analysis
- **Total Session Time**: [X hours]
- **Productive Time**: [X hours]
- **Wasted Time**: [X hours]
- **Efficiency Ratio**: [Productive/Total]

### Progress Tracking
- **Initial State**: [Brief description]
- **Expected End State**: [What should have been achieved]
- **Actual End State**: [What was actually achieved]
- **Progress Made**: [Quantifiable improvements]

## Recommendations

### For Future Interactions
- [ ] Verify all claims before proceeding
- [ ] Request evidence for "successful" changes
- [ ] Test independently before trusting AI output
- [ ] Document discrepancies immediately

### Escalation Criteria
- [ ] Trust Degradation Score > 7
- [ ] Technical Accuracy Score > 6
- [ ] Problem Resolution Score > 8
- [ ] Pattern of repeated false claims

## Summary Assessment

**Overall Session Quality**: [EXCELLENT/GOOD/POOR/HARMFUL]
**Would Use Assistant Again**: [YES/CONDITIONALLY/NO]
**Key Learnings**: [Bullet points of insights gained]

## Implementation Guidelines

### File Naming Convention

- Use format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_[TASK]_LOG.md`
- Examples:
  - `20250710_085820_TRANSPORT_DEBUG_LOG.md`
  - `20250710_143022_BUILD_SYSTEM_LOG.md`

### Scoring Guidelines

#### Objectivity Requirements

- Base scores on verifiable evidence
- Include debug output, file timestamps, build logs
- Document exact quotes from AI responses
- Track measurable outcomes (build success, test results, etc.)

#### Evidence Standards

- Screenshot/copy actual output
- Include file modification timestamps
- Document step-by-step what was attempted vs. what worked
- Save relevant source code snippets

### Analysis Tools

#### Pattern Detection

- Track recurring phrases/claims across sessions
- Identify systematic gaps between claims and reality
- Monitor improvement/degradation trends over time

#### Aggregate Metrics

- Calculate average scores across sessions
- Identify problematic interaction patterns
- Generate reports for stakeholder review

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Interaction Checklist

- [ ] Document current system state
- [ ] Define clear success criteria
- [ ] Prepare verification methods

### Post-Interaction Checklist

- [ ] Verify all claimed changes
- [ ] Test functionality independently
- [ ] Document actual vs. expected outcomes
- [ ] Update interaction log

### Continuous Improvement

- Review logs weekly for patterns
- Adjust interaction strategies based on findings
- Share insights with team for collective learning

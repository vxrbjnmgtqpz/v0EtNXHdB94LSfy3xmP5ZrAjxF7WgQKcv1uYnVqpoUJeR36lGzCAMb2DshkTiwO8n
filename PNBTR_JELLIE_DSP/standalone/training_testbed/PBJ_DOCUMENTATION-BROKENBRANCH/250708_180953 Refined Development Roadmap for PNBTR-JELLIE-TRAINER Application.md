Understood. I’ll create a refined and actionable development roadmap for the PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER app. This will address all key concerns: fixing the JUCE+CMake build structure, resolving linker and integration errors, connecting the audio input/output and neural DSP pipeline, and cleanly implementing the GUI based on the schematic you provided.I’ll structure this as a comprehensive guide from initial setup through to real-time performance validation.I’ll get started and update you once the full roadmap is ready.# PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER Development RoadmapThis roadmap provides a step-by-step plan to build the **PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER** application from scratch. It addresses project setup, recurring build issues, DSP pipeline integration, UI wiring, testing, and common pitfalls. The goal is to follow a structured approach so the team can successfully implement the app while avoiding past mistakes.## Phase 1: Proper JUCE + CMake SetupIn this phase, set up a minimal JUCE application project with a clean structure and CMake configuration. This ensures that the foundation is solid before adding complex DSP or UI code.1. **Establish Project Structure:** Create a clear directory layout for the project. For example, use a top-level `Source` (or `src`) directory with subfolders for different components (e.g. `Source/GUI`, `Source/DSP`, `Source/metrics`). Include a separate folder for any JUCE-specific or platform-specific code (e.g. `Source/Platform` or `standalone/juce` for recording/playback utilities). Organize header and source files logically (e.g. `jellie_encoder.h/cpp` in a DSP folder, GUI components in a GUI folder, etc.). This makes it easier to list all source files in CMake and ensure nothing is missing.2. **Add JUCE via CMake (FetchContent):** Integrate JUCE into the project using CMake’s FetchContent or as a submodule. In the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, call `FetchContent` to retrieve the JUCE library at configure time (or use `find_package(JUCE CONFIG REQUIRED)` if JUCE is pre-installed). This provides the `juce_add_gui_app` function and JUCE modules for use in your project. Ensure you include required JUCE modules (e.g. `juce_core`, `juce_gui_basics`, `juce_audio_devices`, etc.) when adding your target.3. **Declare the App Target with `juce_add_gui_app`:** Use JUCE’s CMake API to add an **application** target (not a plugin). For example:   ```cmake   juce_add_gui_app(PNBTRJellieTrainer       PRODUCT_NAME "PNBTR-JELLIE Trainer")   ```   This function creates an executable target for a GUI app. Make sure **not** to use any plugin template or `juce_add_audio_plugin` for this project – it should be a standalone application. By using `juce_add_gui_app`, you ensure the build is configured for an app with a `main` entry point.4. **List Source Files Properly in CMake:** Add all relevant source **.cpp/.mm** files to the target. Use `target_sources(PNBTRJellieTrainer PRIVATE ... )` to list your source files. **Do not list header files** in the sources – only include the implementation files (C++ and any Objective-C++ .mm files). JUCE’s CMake will handle header inclusion automatically, and listing headers can confuse the unity build. Also set the include directories for the target to point to the base `Source` directory (so that headers in subfolders can be found) instead of adding every subfolder individually. For example:   ```cmake   target_sources(PNBTRJellieTrainer PRIVATE       Source/Main.cpp       Source/PnbtrJellieTrainerApp.cpp       Source/GUI/MainComponent.cpp       ... [other .cpp/.mm files] ...   )   target_include_directories(PNBTRJellieTrainer PRIVATE        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Source)   ```   Double-check that **every** new source file you create is added in CMakeLists (and at the correct relative path) to avoid missing symbols later. This includes all modules outlined in the schematic (encoder, network sim, decoder, GUI components, etc.).5. **Implement a Minimal Application Entry Point:** Create a barebones JUCE application to verify the project builds. This means:   * Make a `Main.cpp` that contains **only** the `START_JUCE_APPLICATION` macro and includes the header for your JUCE `Application` class. For example:     ```cpp     #include "PnbtrJellieTrainerApp.h"     START_JUCE_APPLICATION(PnbtrJellieTrainerApp)     ```   * Define the `PnbtrJellieTrainerApp` class (subclass of `juce::JUCEApplication` or `JUCEApplicationBase`) in a header (`PnbtrJellieTrainerApp.h`) and implement it in `PnbtrJellieTrainerApp.cpp`. This class should implement at minimum the `initialise()` and `shutdown()` methods and create a main window (e.g. a `MainWindow` class holding a `MainComponent`). Keep this initial window simple (even a blank window or a placeholder component) to ensure the GUI framework is working. Following this structure – a separate main file for the entry point and an Application class in its own files – is crucial for JUCE’s CMake to link the app correctly. The main `.cpp` with the macro provides the program’s entry point, and having it separate from the app logic avoids multiple definitions or omissions of `main()`.6. **Link Required Frameworks/Libraries:** If your application directly uses platform APIs (e.g. CoreAudio for input/output on macOS, as suggested by the `.mm` file), link those frameworks in CMake. For macOS, you may need to link CoreAudio, AudioUnit, AVFoundation, Cocoa, etc. Ensure your `target_link_libraries` or JUCE settings include these frameworks and the necessary JUCE modules. For example:   ```cmake   target_link_libraries(PNBTRJellieTrainer PRIVATE        juce::juce_gui_basics        juce::juce_audio_devices        # ... other JUCE modules ...       "-framework CoreAudio"       "-framework AudioUnit"       "-framework AVFoundation"       "-framework Cocoa"       "-framework Foundation")   ```   (JUCE modules will often bring in some frameworks automatically, but explicitly adding CoreAudio/AVFoundation is wise if using CoreAudio APIs directly.)7. **Build the Skeleton Application:** Run the CMake configure and build steps. For example, create a `build` directory, run CMake, then compile the project. On macOS, ensure you pass the proper options (like `-DUSE_REAL_PROCESSING=ON` if defined in the CMake) and target the correct architecture if needed. After building, verify that the application binary was produced and that its size is non-trivial (indicating that JUCE and your code are linked in). Run the app – it should launch a basic window. This confirms that the JUCE setup and CMake configuration are correct, with no missing symbols or startup errors.   **Tip:** At this stage, if the build fails or the app doesn’t start, double-check the CMakeLists and main entry point structure immediately. A common mistake is forgetting the `START_JUCE_APPLICATION` macro or misconfiguring the CMake target. Ensure no linker errors (like an undefined `_main`) are present – there should be none if the above steps were done correctly.## Phase 2: Fixing Linker/Startup ErrorsIf you encountered linker errors (especially a missing `_main` symbol or entry point) or startup crashes in Phase 1, this phase addresses how to resolve them. These errors typically stem from an incorrect project structure in a JUCE+CMake context. Below are steps and debugging tips to fix such issues:1. **Understand the Error:** A linker error about an undefined `_main` (on macOS) or unresolved external symbol `WinMain` (on Windows) means the application entry point was not linked. In JUCE apps, this usually happens if the `START_JUCE_APPLICATION` macro wasn’t compiled or was placed incorrectly. This macro generates the `main()` function for the app, so if it's missing, the executable has no entry point.2. **Correct the Entry Point Placement:** Ensure that **exactly one** .cpp file contains `START_JUCE_APPLICATION(MyAppClass)`, and that this file is included in the build. The macro should reference your JUCE Application subclass name. For example, if your app class is `PnbtrJellieTrainerApp`, the macro should be `START_JUCE_APPLICATION(PnbtrJellieTrainerApp)`. A common error is accidentally putting this macro in multiple files or in the wrong file. It **must** reside in the standalone `Main.cpp` (or equivalent) and nowhere else. If you had previously put the macro at the end of your App class implementation file, remove that to avoid conflicts. After relocation, update CMake if needed to compile the new `Main.cpp`.3. **Project Type Mismatch:** Verify that you are building a GUI application target. If your CMakeLists was copied from a plugin or incorrectly set, the build system might be treating the code as a plugin (which expects no `main()` and will cause conflicts if `START_JUCE_APPLICATION` is present). The solution is to use `juce_add_gui_app` (for a standalone app) as done in Phase 1, and **not** use any plugin template functions. Double-check the CMake config and remove any plugin-specific declarations.4. **CMake Source File List Issues:** Make sure all necessary source files (including the one with the `START_JUCE_APPLICATION` macro) are listed in the `target_sources`. If the file containing `main` was omitted, the linker can’t find the entry point. Also remove any header files from the source list – listing headers in the build can confuse JUCE’s unified build system and prevent the actual `Main.cpp` from being compiled properly. Keep the CMake sources list to just the `.cpp` and `.mm` files that implement the code.5. **Clean and Reconfigure:** After making structural fixes, do a clean build: delete the build directory, re-run CMake, then compile. This ensures no old build artifacts are causing confusion. Watch the build output for any warnings about missing source files or duplicate symbols. If the build succeeds, the `_main` error should be gone.6. **Debugging Techniques:** If problems persist, use these tips:   * **Examine Linker Output:** Use verbose linking flags or inspect the linker command to see which object files are being linked. Confirm that the object corresponding to `Main.cpp` is present. If not, it's being excluded – check CMakeLists and file paths again.   * **Use Simplified Code:** Temporarily simplify `Main.cpp` and your Application class to the bare minimum (just create a window with JUCE’s `JUCEApplicationBase` with no DSP) to isolate the issue. Once the basic app runs, you can grow it again.   * **Leverage JUCE Examples:** Compare your structure with a known working JUCE CMake example (like JUCE’s GuiApp example or Projucer’s CMakeLists). Ensure your project uses a similar pattern for declaring the app.   * **Logging and Assertions:** Add debug `DBG()` logs or `jassert` statements in the early startup (e.g., in `initialise()`) to see if the app is reaching that point. If nothing prints, the app isn’t entering `initialise()` at all, indicating the entry point isn’t being hit.   * **Consult Error Messages:** The exact text of the error is instructive. For example, an error pointing to `START_JUCE_APPLICATION` or `_main` confirms the entry point issue. Other missing symbol errors might indicate a file not compiled or a library not linked (revisit Phase 1 to ensure all files and libraries are included).By the end of this phase, the application should build and launch reliably. All linker errors (like missing entry point) and startup crashes should be resolved by adhering to the correct JUCE project structure and CMake configuration. Once the skeleton app runs (showing a window), you can proceed to integrate the audio DSP pipeline.## Phase 3: DSP Pipeline IntegrationWith a working skeleton app, the next phase is to build the real-time audio processing pipeline. The PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER processes live audio through several stages: JELLIE encoding, network simulation, and PNBTR decoding, ultimately producing reconstructed audio output. This phase focuses on implementing and connecting these DSP components step by step, while maintaining thread safety.1. **Implement Audio I/O Callbacks:** Set up real-time audio input and output. You can use JUCE’s audio callbacks (e.g. via `AudioAppComponent` or `AudioDeviceManager` with an `AudioIODeviceCallback`). Given the schematic’s mention of CoreAudio in `PnbtrJellieGUIApp_Fixed.mm`, you might be interfacing with CoreAudio directly on macOS. In either case, ensure you can capture microphone input into a buffer and play back an output buffer. At first, you might route the input directly to output (bypass encoding/decoding) to test basic audio flow. Use atomic or lock mechanisms for any global audio buffers (e.g. an `std::atomic<bool>` flag for new data, `std::mutex` around buffer writes).2. **Integrate the JELLIE Encoder:** Develop the JELLIE encoding stage (`jellie_encoder.cpp`). This module takes the incoming audio buffer (e.g. 48kHz mic input) and processes it to a higher rate and quantized format (as described: upsample to 192kHz and 24-bit quantization). Implement the upsampling, then distribute samples over the 8 JDAT channels (if JELLIE uses multiple sub-channels). The output of this stage should be an encoded data structure (e.g. a vector or buffer `jellieEncoded`). At this point, you can still pass the audio through to output for testing, or if possible, decode it back to audio to ensure the encoder isn't producing corrupt data (if a temporary decode is feasible). Connect the encoder in the audio callback or processing chain: after capturing input into `inputBuffer`, call the JELLIE encoder to produce `jellieEncoded`. Make sure to remove any placeholder code; use real processing logic here so the data is meaningful.3. **Add Network Simulation Stage:** Implement the network simulation in `network_sim.cpp`. This stage will take `jellieEncoded` data and simulate packet loss and jitter before passing it on. Start with a simple simulation: e.g., drop a fixed percentage of packets (2% default) and possibly introduce a slight reordering or delay to simulate jitter. Use parameters that can be adjusted (we'll connect these to UI sliders in the next phase). Maintain an output buffer or structure `networkProcessed` that represents the possibly degraded data stream. **Thread-safety:** If this simulation runs on a separate thread or timer (it might, if not done inside the audio callback), ensure shared data (the encoded buffer) is accessed atomically or with locks. Also, keep track of network stats (packets sent, lost, etc.) using atomic counters or a thread-safe mechanism, as these will feed into the metrics module. For now, integrate the network step after encoding: e.g., in the audio processing loop, take `jellieEncoded`, run the network simulation (perhaps inline for simplicity), and produce `networkProcessed`. Initially, you can set packet loss to 0 (no loss) to verify the pipeline doesn’t break the audio.4. **Integrate the PNBTR Decoder (Neural Reconstruction):** Implement the PNBTR reconstruction module in `pnbtr_recon.cpp`. This component should take the possibly lossy `networkProcessed` data and attempt to reconstruct the missing audio packets, producing a final audio output buffer (`reconstructedBuffer`) at 48kHz to send to the speakers. Depending on the complexity (neural network inference), you might need to load a model or perform some computation. In early development, you might stub this with a simple pass-through or interpolation for lost packets, just to complete the pipeline. The key is that `reconstructedBuffer` should contain audio at the original sample rate, with gaps filled in as well as possible. Integrate this decoder into the processing chain: after the network sim, call the PNBTR reconstructor to get the output audio. Then deliver this `reconstructedBuffer` to the audio output (either directly copying to the JUCE output buffers in the audio callback, or storing it to be read in the next callback). **Real-time consideration:** If the reconstruction is heavy (neural net inference), you may need to perform it in smaller chunks or on a separate thread to avoid blocking the audio IO callback. For now, ensure correctness of data flow. Every stage (input -> encoder -> network -> decoder -> output) is now linked in sequence.5. **Maintain Thread-Safe Buffers:** Throughout the pipeline, use thread-safe practices for any data that crosses threads:   * If using the JUCE audio callback for the whole pipeline, you might keep everything on the audio thread. In that case, thread safety issues are less about the pipeline and more about sharing data with the UI or other threads.   * If splitting tasks (e.g., a background thread does encoding/decoding or metrics), protect shared buffers. Use `std::atomic_flag` or a lock to indicate buffer readiness. Avoid unnecessary heap allocations in the real-time thread; reuse buffers or allocate upfront.   * For example, the microphone input might fill an `inputBuffer` that is then read by the encoder. Mark this buffer atomic or use a lock around it. Similarly, the output buffer might be read by the UI oscilloscope – consider using a lock or a lock-free FIFO to transfer data to the GUI component.   * Ensure that each module operates on its own copy of data or is carefully synchronized if operating in place. Data races can cause audio glitches or crashes, so follow the rule: **all real-time data must use atomic or lock mechanisms when shared across threads**.6. **Test the Audio Path Incrementally:** As you add each stage, test the pipeline:   * After adding the encoder, run the app: does audio still output (even if just forwarded)? If possible, compare the input vs output if you decode the encoded data.   * After adding network sim, test with 0% loss (should behave like no network) and then with a high loss to see if audio drops out as expected.   * After adding the PNBTR decoder, verify that when you simulate packet loss, the decoder is producing output (it might sound like filled gaps or a continuous output even when packets drop). If the decoder is not fully implemented yet, you might just hear dropouts – which is fine initially.   * Use logging (on a debug console or the log window) to print out stage-by-stage info: e.g., "Captured X samples", "Encoded frame N", "Lost packet at N", "Reconstructed segment N". This will help trace the pipeline behavior during testing.By the end of Phase 3, you should have a functioning real-time DSP pipeline: **mic input → JELLIE encoder → network sim → PNBTR decoder → speaker output**. The core audio handling and DSP logic are in place. Next, you'll connect these internals to a user interface for visualization and control.## Phase 4: UI Implementation PlanWith the DSP backbone working, implement the graphical user interface and connect it to the pipeline. The UI will include oscilloscopes for waveforms, controls (buttons, sliders), a log/status display, and a metrics dashboard. Build the UI in parts, verifying each element with real data.1. **Oscilloscope Waveform Displays:** Create custom UI components to visualize the audio waveforms for key points: at minimum, one for the input (mic) signal and one for the output (reconstructed) signal. You might use JUCE’s drawing functions to plot the waveform or use an existing helper (like `AudioVisualiserComponent`). Set up an **oscilloscope component** class (e.g. `OscilloscopeComponent` in `oscilloscope.cpp`) that can receive audio buffers and render them. Connect these components to the real audio buffers: for example, have the audio callback or a timer periodically copy the latest chunk of `inputBuffer` into a FIFO that the oscilloscope reads and draws. Do similarly for `reconstructedBuffer`. The goal is that when audio is running, the oscilloscope UIs show live waveforms (no more test or placeholder patterns). In the schematic, all oscilloscopes should be wired to real buffers. **Tip:** Because the audio processing is on a high-priority thread, do not directly draw or allocate memory there. Instead, use a lock-free FIFO or `AbstractFifo` to push samples from the audio thread to the GUI, and have a `juce::Timer` in the oscilloscope component trigger a repaint at, say, 30-60 FPS by reading from that FIFO. This ensures thread safety and smooth drawing.2. **Control Panel (Buttons & Sliders):** Implement the UI controls for starting/stopping audio, exporting recordings, and adjusting simulation parameters. This could be a toolbar or a set of buttons and sliders on the main window or a dedicated control panel component (`controls.cpp`):   * **Start/Stop Buttons:** These should connect to functions that start or stop the audio processing. For example, Start might open the audio device (or un-mute the callback) and begin capturing from the mic, while Stop will halt audio I/O. Wire the button callbacks to call your audio start/stop logic (which you might implement in the main app or audio handling class).   * **Export Button:** This triggers the exporting of data – i.e., saving the recorded input and output buffers to WAV files and possibly saving metrics. It should call a function like `exportWAV()` or similar that you will implement (likely in the recording module). We will detail exporting in Phase 5, but set up the button now.   * **Sliders (Packet Loss, Jitter, Gain):** These allow real-time adjustment of network simulation parameters and possibly audio gain. For packet loss and jitter sliders, connect their values to the network simulation module: e.g., when the slider moves, call a method in `network_sim` to update the loss percentage or jitter amount (which should be stored in an `std::atomic<float>` or similar used by the simulation each time it runs). For gain, you might apply it in the output stage (or input) – for instance, a simple multiplier on the audio buffer. Make sure the slider UI updates do not directly modify audio data from the GUI thread; instead, update atomic variables that the audio thread reads. Implement these slider callbacks in `controls.cpp` and ensure they affect the DSP pipeline accordingly.3. **Log/Status Window:** Implement a log display (e.g. a multi-line text box or list box) that shows real-time events and status messages. This is crucial for debugging and user feedback. Use a thread-safe logging mechanism: for example, create a function `logMessage(String msg)` in `log.cpp` that appends the message to a FIFO or buffer. The Log UI component can periodically fetch new messages (on the Message Thread) and display them (or use `juce::MessageManager::callAsync` to schedule UI updates when a new message arrives). Log important events: audio start/stop, errors (like “XRuns” or buffer underflows), changes in packet loss, when recording begins/ends, etc. According to the plan, **all major events and errors should be logged to this window**. This will help during testing (Phase 5) to see what's happening under the hood. Keep the log UI read-only and auto-scrolling as new messages come in.4. **Metrics Dashboard:** Create a GUI element (or a section of the main window) that displays calculated metrics: SNR, THD, latency, packet loss rate, gap fill rate, overall quality, etc. This could be a combination of text labels and progress bars or level indicators for each metric. The `metrics_display.cpp` (GUI side) will fetch metrics values from the `metrics.cpp` (DSP side) and show them. Implementation plan:   * In `metrics.cpp`, as audio runs, compute metrics in real-time or near-real-time. Some metrics like instantaneous SNR or THD can be calculated on the fly (e.g. every buffer or every second compare input vs output). Others like latency might require measuring time differences or known markers. Packet loss rate can be tracked from the network sim counters. Gap fill quality might be derived from how well the decoder fills gaps (if you have a reference).   * Ensure these calculations are efficient. Possibly update metrics on a timer or background thread (not every audio callback if it’s heavy). Use atomic variables or a struct to store the latest values.   * The GUI (metrics\_display component) can use a Timer (e.g. update 2 times a second) to pull the latest values and update the display. For example, it might call `Metrics::getCurrentSNR()` which returns an atomic float, then it updates a label or bar accordingly.   * Make the dashboard update in real-time with *plausible* values, meaning when conditions change (e.g., you increase packet loss), the metrics should reflect that (SNR drops, gap fill percentage changes, etc.). This will be an important validation in testing.   * Start with a few core metrics (maybe just packet loss % and a simple SNR or waveform correlation metric) to get the plumbing working, then refine the calculations. The key is that by the end, the metrics displayed should help the user quantify the performance of the reconstruction.5. **Integrate UI with Application Lifecycle:** Make sure the UI components tie into the app properly:   * The Main Window should contain or lay out all these subcomponents (oscilloscopes, control panel, log, metrics). Design a reasonable layout – e.g., two waveforms (input/output) side by side or top/bottom, controls at the top, log and metrics on a side panel. This matches the original schematic layout (Input Oscilloscope, Network Oscilloscope, Log, Output Oscilloscope in a grid, with controls at bottom).   * When the app starts, the audio is likely stopped – perhaps only the input oscilloscope might show ambient noise. When the user hits Start, then audio flows and all UI components should become active. Plan the logic such that starting audio also resets counters, clears old logs, etc., to give a clean session.   * Ensure to **update UI components on the Message Thread**. If any DSP code needs to trigger a UI change (e.g., an alert on high latency), use `MessageManager::callAsync` or `AsyncUpdater` patterns rather than directly manipulating UI from the audio thread.   * Remove any temporary UI test code (for example, if oscilloscopes were displaying fake signals for demo, eliminate that now so they only show real data).By the end of Phase 4, the application should have a functional user interface that is fully wired to the live data. You should be able to see the microphone waveform in the input oscilloscope, observe the output waveform (with gaps filled) in the output oscilloscope, adjust network parameters via sliders, start/stop audio with buttons, and watch metrics updating and logs streaming in real-time. All UI elements should reflect the actual processing happening under the hood (no placeholder visuals).## Phase 5: Testing, Validation, and ExportingNow that the full system (DSP + UI) is in place, rigorously test the application end-to-end, validate the outputs, and implement the exporting of data and metrics. This phase ensures that the app not only works in theory but produces correct and useful results in practice.1. **End-to-End Audio Test:** Run the application in real-time with a microphone and speakers/headphones:   * Click **Start** and speak into the mic. You should hear your voice (possibly with some small delay if the pipeline introduces latency) coming out of the output. Both input and output oscilloscopes should show the waveforms of your voice in real time. This confirms the basic pipeline is working.   * While running, adjust the Packet Loss and Jitter sliders to simulate network issues. At moderate or high packet loss, you should observe the output audio degrade (dropouts or distortions) and the output waveform showing gaps or reconstruction artifacts. If PNBTR’s reconstruction is effective, you may still hear continuous audio despite packet loss (gaps filled in). The **Network Sim oscilloscope** (if you have one for network stage) would show missing packets as breaks in the signal. Verify that these UI indications make sense.   * Try the Gain slider if implemented – increasing it should amplify the output volume (ensure it doesn’t clip or cause distortion in the output waveform).2. **Metrics Validation:** Check that the metrics dashboard reacts correctly:   * With no packet loss (0%), metrics like SNR or quality should be high (e.g. near 100% quality, since output \~= input). Introduce packet loss and ensure metrics like SNR drop to reflect the lost information, and the “packet loss rate” metric matches the slider setting. If you have a latency metric, measure a known delay (you could snap or make a sound and see if latency number matches the audible delay).   * Check any THD (distortion) metric by perhaps introducing a pure tone and measuring harmonic distortion.   * The metrics values should update in real-time on the UI. Compare them with expectations or offline calculations if possible. For example, record a test tone input and output and compute SNR manually to see if the app’s SNR calculation is reasonable.   * If any metric seems off, inspect the `metrics.cpp` calculations – ensure you’re comparing the correct buffers (e.g. don’t compare input to itself by accident, compare input vs output for SNR) and that the data ranges (dB vs linear) are handled properly. Refine as needed until the dashboard shows **plausible values** for all metrics during various scenarios.3. **Recording & Playback:** Implement and test the audio recording features:   * The app should record the input (JELLIE) and output (PNBTR) signals to WAV files, likely when the user clicks **Export** or when stopping the session. Using JUCE’s `AudioFormatWriter`, write the contents of the input and reconstructed output buffers to two WAV files. This might be done in `recording.cpp`. Consider doing this on the **Stop** action or explicitly on **Export**. For example, when the user clicks Export, call a function that writes `inputBuffer` to `JELLIE_recording.wav` and `reconstructedBuffer` to `PNBTR_recording.wav`. You may need to accumulate or store the entire session’s audio data in a buffer or file, since the live buffers might be small.   * After implementing, test the recording: run a session for a while (speaking into mic), then click Export/Stop to produce the WAVs. Open these files in an audio player or DAW to confirm they contain audio. The input recording should match what was captured from the mic, and the output recording should match what was heard (with losses/reconstructions).   * Implement **Playback controls** (if specified): this might involve using `juce::AudioThumbnail` to display the waveform of the recorded files and `juce::AudioTransportSource` to allow playback within the app. This can be an added bonus: after recording, show the waveform of the recording in the UI (perhaps replacing an oscilloscope with a static waveform view) and allow the user to play it back. Ensure the playback uses a separate audio path (not interfering with live capture).   * If playback is complex to implement, you can consider it a lower priority. The main requirement is that the WAV export works correctly and the files are saved (e.g., in a known directory or prompt the user to save).4. **Exporting Metrics:** In addition to audio, export the metrics and any relevant session information:   * This could be as simple as writing a log or text file summarizing the session: e.g., average packet loss, average SNR, maybe a timestamped log of events. The schematic mentions exporting a metrics report. Design a format (CSV or JSON or plain text) and write metrics like final values or perhaps time series if needed.   * For example, create a `metrics_report.txt` that says: *Packet Loss: 5%, Average SNR: 18 dB, Gaps Filled: 20, Overall Quality: 92%* etc., along with timestamp and maybe any notable events (like "dropout occurred at 10s"). You can gather these from the metrics module and log module at stop time.   * Test that after a run, the metrics report reflects what happened (compare with UI during run). Ensure that this file writing is done after audio stops (to avoid disk I/O during real-time audio).   * Also ensure the log window’s contents can be saved or are at least printed to console for debugging purposes (optional).5. **Robustness Testing:** Try to break the app in controlled ways to ensure stability:   * Start/stop the audio rapidly or multiple times. The app should handle it (no crashes, and audio should resume properly on each start).   * Run for an extended time to see if any memory usage grows (possible leaks) or performance degrades.   * Test extreme slider values: 100% packet loss (output should essentially be silence or whatever the decoder does), maximum jitter, maximum gain (ensure no clipping).   * If possible, test with different input sources (maybe a virtual audio cable playing music) to see how the system handles non-voice signals.   * Verify the app behaves well when no mic is available or if the audio device is lost (e.g., unplugging microphone) – it should log an error in the log window rather than crash.6. **Final Verification Checklist:** Before considering the app complete, go through a final checklist (adapted from the schematic’s tips) to ensure everything is truly working with **real data**:   * Mic input is visible on the input oscilloscope (try a few different sound sources).   * Network simulation controls indeed affect the audio and are reflected in the network stats/metrics.   * PNBTR output oscilloscope shows a waveform that corresponds to input but with losses filled in (no placeholder signal).   * The metrics dashboard updates in real-time and shows reasonable values (no static dummy numbers).   * Recording and export functions produce valid .wav files and a metrics report (open the wavs to confirm audio, open the report to confirm content).   * The log window contains a trace of events (start/stop, parameter changes, any errors) that is consistent with what happened.   * All placeholder or test code has been removed (search the code for keywords like "placeholder", "fake", "test pattern" to be sure).   * Run the app with **debug logging enabled** (if you have verbose logging) to see if any hidden errors or warnings pop up in the console or log window. Address any issues found.   If any of the above checks fail, revisit the corresponding module or code and fix the problem, then test again. By iterating, you will ensure the final product is solid.## Phase 6: Common Pitfalls to AvoidThroughout development, be mindful of common pitfalls that have caused issues in the past. Here is a summary of mistakes to avoid and important best practices:* **JUCE/CMake Structure Mistakes:** Avoid incorrect project setups. Do not mix plugin and app targets (use the proper `juce_add_gui_app` for this project). Ensure the `START_JUCE_APPLICATION` macro is used exactly once in the correct place. A redundant or misplaced macro (or class definition) can cause link conflicts or runtime issues. Similarly, list only source files (no headers) in CMake and set the include path to your source directory. Double-check that every source file you intend to compile is actually included in the CMakeLists – missing files lead to missing symbols at link time.* **Threading and Real-Time Safety:** All audio processing that runs in real time must be thread-safe. Use lock-free structures or minimal locking around shared data. **Never update the GUI directly from an audio thread.** Use the Message Thread for UI updates (e.g., `MessageManager::callAsync` or `AsyncUpdater`). Failing to do so can crash the app or freeze the interface. Also, heavy computations (neural nets, file I/O) should not happen on the audio callback thread – they can cause audio dropouts. If needed, perform these on a background thread and buffer the results.* **Incorrect Use of Atomics/Locks:** Make sure to use `std::atomic` for simple flags/counters (e.g., a boolean indicating new data, or the network packet counters) and mutexes for protecting buffers when necessary. However, avoid excessive locking in the audio path. A common pitfall is locking a mutex in the audio callback for too long, which can glitch audio. Use lock-free FIFOs or double-buffering strategies for transferring data to UI or between threads.* **Logging and Debugging in Real-Time:** Be cautious with logging in the audio thread – using `printf` or writing to console can block. Instead, accumulate logs in a buffer and flush from the main thread. This avoids stalling the audio. Similarly, avoid popping up message boxes or heavy UI alerts from background threads.* **Placeholder Code and Test Artifacts:** Remove or disable any placeholder, fake, or test code before final build. For example, if you had a test tone generator or a fake network simulation for initial UI work, ensure it’s fully replaced by the real implementation. Leftover stub code can give misleading results (e.g., metrics showing fixed values, or oscilloscopes displaying a hard-coded waveform). Search the codebase for keywords like "TODO", "placeholder", "demo" to ensure such code is eliminated.* **Resource Management:** Remember to properly manage resources like audio devices and file handles. For instance, when stopping the audio, close or release the audio device if needed. When writing to WAV, close the writer properly (or let it go out of scope) to ensure the file is finalized. Not doing so can lead to file corruption or devices not reopening on next start.* **UI Responsiveness:** Complex drawing (like rendering long waveform thumbnails) should be done efficiently. Use decimation for drawing long waveforms (AudioThumbnail is useful for this). Also ensure the UI has a reasonable refresh rate and doesn’t hog the CPU (Timers rather than continuously repainting in a loop). If the UI becomes unresponsive or sluggish, profile where time is spent (perhaps the metrics calculations or an overly frequent redraw).* **Matching CMake and Code:** It’s easy to refactor code (e.g., move a file or rename a class) and forget to update CMake or vice versa. This will cause build issues or, worse, compile but use old code. Always update the CMakeLists with any new .cpp files and ensure the file paths are correct. If you encounter an undefined symbol at link time, verify that the corresponding .cpp is included in the build. Conversely, if you have a file listed in CMake that no longer exists, remove it to avoid confusion.* **Testing Iteratively:** A pitfall is trying to build the entire system and only then testing – this makes debugging hard because many variables change at once. Instead, as outlined, test incrementally after each major addition. If something fails, check the **log window, console output, and CMake output** for clues. Use assertions and verbose logging in debug mode to catch issues early. It’s much easier to locate a bug when you’ve only added one new component than after adding ten.* **Documentation and Deviations:** If during development you find you need to change the plan (for example, using a different approach for audio I/O or altering how a metric is calculated), document it in the project README. This is not a functional pitfall per se, but it’s a best practice to avoid future confusion. The original schematic/roadmap is a guide, but real projects evolve – just keep track of changes for the team’s benefit.By keeping these pitfalls in mind and following the roadmap’s phases, the team will be equipped to build the PNBTR-JELLIE-TRAINER application successfully. Each phase builds upon the previous one, and by validating at each step, you can catch and fix issues early. The result will be a robust application with a clean build, real-time audio processing, and an informative UI, meeting the goals of the project. Good luck with the development, and happy coding!

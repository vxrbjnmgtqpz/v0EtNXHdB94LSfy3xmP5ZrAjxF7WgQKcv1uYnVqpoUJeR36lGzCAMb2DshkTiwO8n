Modern Game Engine Practices for a Real-Time DSP/DAW EngineFrame Pacing and Real-Time ThreadsModern game engines prioritize consistent frame pacing and thread separation to maintain responsiveness. Unity, for example, splits its update loop into a variable-time step main loop and a fixed-time step loop for physics. Game logic updates run once per rendered frame with a variable delta-time, whereas physics and other time-critical updates run at a fixed rate (e.g. 50 Hz by default) independent of render frames ￼ ￼. This means Unity will execute multiple physics (FixedUpdate) steps in one frame if the frame rate slows down, or skip some if the frame rate is higher than the fixed step rate, to keep the simulation in sync with real time ￼. Such decoupling ensures determinism and prevents instability (“spiral of death”) when the CPU is under load. Unreal Engine similarly supports fixed-timestep physics sub-stepping and decouples the render thread from the game thread – the entire renderer runs on its own thread, typically operating a frame or two behind the game logic ￼. This pipelined design maximizes GPU usage by allowing the CPU to prepare the next frame while the GPU is rendering the previous, keeping both busy in parallel. Godot Engine also follows a model with an idle step (for rendering/logic) and a physics step; it can run physics at a fixed rate (e.g. _PhysicsProcess) separate from the visual frame rate to ensure consistent behavior under load.Responsiveness Under Load: To prevent UI or audio hitching when the system is stressed, game engines offload work to background threads and maintain strict budgets for real-time tasks. Most modern engines use job systems or task schedulers to split large tasks into small jobs that run concurrently across CPU cores ￼. This pattern (seen in Unreal’s task graph system and Unity’s C# Job System) allows high-priority tasks (like input handling, UI, audio) to run on time, while less critical work is spread out. For instance, Unreal and Unity assign audio mixing to a dedicated high-priority thread, so even if the main thread is late on a frame, the audio thread can still mix and output sound at the required 20ms or better interval ￼. Audio middleware like FMOD explicitly ticks the audio engine on a fixed schedule (e.g. 50 Hz), decoupled from the game loop, to ensure audio isn’t starved by a slow frame ￼. In FMOD’s asynchronous mode, the studio update runs every 20ms triggered by the audio mixer, so “the update will be called in a timely manner, even if the game’s main thread has a framerate spike” ￼ ￼. This principle should be applied to the JAMNet trainer: use separate, real-time threads for critical DSP/audio processing, running on a fixed high-frequency timestep (e.g. audio buffer blocks), while the UI and graphics run on decoupled threads potentially at lower rates. If the GPU or UI falls behind, the audio thread must continue delivering audio on time to avoid glitches. Techniques like double-buffering frames (so rendering can lag one frame behind logic without harm ￼) and limiting per-frame work (using time-sliced processing) can keep the UI responsive.Fixed vs Variable Timestep: In a DAW-as-engine context, it’s wise to mirror game engines’ use of a fixed update for time-sensitive processing. The audio callback can be treated like a fixed-update loop (e.g. 128 samples per tick = ~2.9ms) that should run reliably on schedule. Visual updates (waveforms, UI animations) can use variable timesteps, with interpolation where needed, so they degrade gracefully with frame rate. This way, heavy DSP computations don’t directly slow down the GUI: if DSP load increases, the GUI might drop frames but audio timing remains steady. Unity enforces an upper bound on the delta-time reported to game logic to avoid huge physics catch-ups after big stalls ￼ – similarly, JAMNet could impose limits (or frame-skips) if the UI thread lags, rather than queuing an unbounded backlog of updates that would cause latency spikes.Modular Scene Graph and Entity/Component SystemsEntity-Component Systems (ECS) and scene graphs in engines enable modular, composable behavior – an approach that can model DSP signal flows elegantly. In Unity and Unreal, an Entity or Actor is a container of components that each handle a facet of behavior (e.g. a Transform component for position, an AudioSource component for sound). For a DSP engine, one could treat each audio module or node as an entity with components for its processing algorithm, input/output ports, and UI representation. This maps well to a graph of DSP nodes: for example, an Oscillator entity might have a DSP component generating the waveform and a visual component drawing its output on an oscilloscope UI. The connections between modules (signal routing) can be represented similarly to a scene graph’s node connections or through explicit “wiring” objects. Godot’s scene tree, which allows nodes to be organized hierarchically and communicate via signals, is a useful analog – one could instantiate a graph of Nodes for oscillators, filters, mixers etc., and use Godot’s Signals (its event system) to notify changes or trigger events between them. In practice, Godot’s signals are synchronous (the emitter directly calls connected listeners) ￼, meaning changes propagate immediately. This is low-latency for communication (no polling needed), though it requires careful design to avoid heavy processing in the signal callbacks that could stall the thread.ECS for DSP: Modern ECS implementations (like Unity’s DOTS) are designed for cache-efficient, multithreaded operations on large numbers of entities. While a DAW engine might not have thousands of independent sound sources in the same way a game has many entities, ECS ideas can still improve performance for modular audio. Unity’s experimental DSPGraph audio framework, for instance, uses an ECS/DAG hybrid: it represents the audio processing pipeline as a directed acyclic graph of DSP nodes, and uses the C# Job System with audio kernels (DSP node code) to process audio in parallel ￼ ￼. The DSP graph runs on the audio thread, but heavy nodes can be distributed to worker jobs (“jobified processing”) to reduce wall-clock time ￼ ￼. Adopting a similar approach, JAMNet’s audio modules could be nodes in a graph executed via parallel jobs on available cores, ensuring that even complex effect chains or neural network processing can meet real-time deadlines. The key is to keep the graph acyclic and clear in data flow, so it’s amenable to parallel execution without race conditions.Visualization as Components: Scene graphs are also useful for tying visualization modules (waveform displays, spectrum analyzers, transport timelines) to the underlying audio data. In Unity or Unreal, one might create a “WaveformDisplay” component that registers as a listener to a particular audio node’s output. When that audio node produces a new buffer of audio, it could send a notification or copy a small chunk to a thread-safe buffer that the WaveformDisplay reads and draws. This is analogous to how an engine might have a UI element follow an in-game object’s state via an event or binding. The scene graph provides an organizational structure: for instance, child nodes in Godot could represent UI widgets attached to a particular track or effect, keeping related elements grouped. An Entity-Component design also means new module types can be added by writing new components or entities, without modifying a monolithic engine loop – aligning with modularity and open extension, much like adding a new system in a game engine.Audio Engine Architecture and Low-Latency SchedulingDedicated Audio Threads: Both Unity and Unreal (and virtually all modern engines) isolate audio processing on its own thread for real-time performance. Unreal’s audio mixer runs on a separate thread with a high priority, decoupled from the game thread’s timing. Middleware engines Wwise and FMOD provide a blueprint for how to handle scheduling and mixing in such a thread. They mix dozens or hundreds of voices with minimal latency by employing efficient mixing pipelines and scheduling of audio events ahead of time. For example, FMOD allows scheduling sounds to play at specific DSP clock times (sample-accurate scheduling) so that events stay in sync even if triggered from the main thread slightly late. It also dynamically manages voice resources: sounds can be marked non-streaming (preloaded) if low latency is needed, to avoid disk I/O delays ￼.Scheduling and Mixing: FMOD’s core runs a mixer update roughly every 20ms (with ~1024-sample blocks at 48 kHz) and splits the mix into phases (pre-mix, mix, post-mix). Critically, it queues commands (like “start event” or parameter changes) from the main thread into a command buffer that the audio thread consumes at the start of each block ￼. This design ensures that even if the main thread is momentarily slow, the audio thread still receives updates at block boundaries, avoiding perceptible delay. (If the command buffer overflows with too many rapid updates, FMOD will stall the producer until the audio thread catches up ￼ – indicating the importance of sizing buffers for peak event bursts). Wwise similarly runs its sound engine on its own thread (“EventMgr” thread). In recent updates, Wwise introduced a more cooperative scheduling model: instead of its audio thread preempting the CPU unpredictably, developers can integrate Wwise into the game’s job system, effectively scheduling audio tasks on engine worker threads at opportune times ￼ ￼. This prevents cases where the audio thread wakes up at a bad moment and causes the main thread to miss its frame deadline (a “dropped frame” in visuals) ￼ ￼. The takeaway for JAMNet: use a high-priority audio thread with predictable timing, and consider integrating with a task scheduler. The audio thread can execute the DSP graph on a fixed interval (e.g. every X ms), but heavy computations inside that tick can be split into jobs that run on other cores (with proper real-time safe techniques as discussed below). This keeps the audio thread’s own workload light and predictable, reducing risk of it overrunning the audio buffer time.Mixing Streams & Latency: In a DAW engine, mixing multiple tracks or plugin outputs corresponds to mixing voices in a game audio engine. Adopting hierarchical mixing (like Wwise’s actor-mixer hierarchy or Unity’s AudioMixer groups) would allow grouping signals (buses) and applying bus-level DSP (like mastering effects) efficiently. Wwise’s improvements show the benefit of optimizing common DSP across many voices (e.g. rewriting its low-pass and high-pass filters to handle many voices with SIMD, gaining 2x-5x throughput) ￼ ￼. For JAMNet, focusing on efficient vectorized DSP for common operations will help maintain sub-millisecond processing times even as channels scale. Additionally, engines use voice virtualization – i.e. if too many sources are active, some are computed at reduced cost or not at all when inaudible – which might translate to turning off or simplifying processing for silent or negligible-contribution signals to save CPU.To achieve millisecond or sub-ms latency, the audio pipeline must minimize buffering and avoid any unnecessary delays. This means using the smallest practical audio buffer size (block size), running the audio thread at real-time priority, and employing lock-free synchronization for cross-thread communication. As Ross Bencina advises for real-time audio, “avoid any kind of interaction with the OS thread scheduler … you don’t want to give [the scheduler] extra reasons to de-schedule your real-time audio thread” ￼. Concretely, the DSP/audio thread should avoid blocking calls, locks, memory allocation, or anything that could cause the OS to pause the thread. Instead, use preallocated buffers and lock-free structures (ring buffers, atomic flags) to exchange data with the UI or other systems. By keeping the audio callback streamlined and independent, JAMNet can reliably hit ~1ms latency targets (for instance, with a 64-sample buffer at 48 kHz ~ 1.33ms, or even 32-sample ~0.67ms, as long as the CPU can complete each block’s work in less time).Asset Pipeline and Hot ReloadingGame engines come with robust asset pipelines that import, preprocess, and manage assets (models, textures, audio files, etc.) for optimal runtime use. They also often support hot-reloading of assets or code to enable rapid iteration. Unity and Unreal, for example, both allow certain changes to be applied without restarting the application: Unity can reload scripts in the Editor and even update live game objects when you recompile code (though with some hitch as it restarts the domain), and Unreal’s Live Coding feature lets you compile C++ changes on the fly during development. Content-wise, Unreal Engine supports auto-reimport of assets – if a source file changes on disk, the editor can detect it and update the in-game asset with minimal interruption ￼ ￼.In audio middleware, Wwise 2024 pushes this further with an uninterrupted workflow between the DAW and game: it introduced Live Media Transfer and expanded Live Editing so you can replace audio files or adjust effect parameters in Wwise and hear the changes instantly in the connected game, without rebuilding banks ￼ ￼. They allow adding new sounds or changing mixing settings on a live game, with the changes applied in-memory for that session ￼ ￼. This concept is highly relevant to JAMNet’s neural model and patch swapping. By treating a machine learning model or a DSP graph preset as an asset, the engine can load and unload these at runtime. For example, one could implement a background asset loader (similar to Unity’s Addressables or Unreal’s Async Loading Thread) that streams in a new neural network file or a new “waveform template” while the audio engine is running, then swaps the pointer to use the new model once ready. The swap should be done at a safe point (e.g., between audio blocks or on a mixer tick boundary) to avoid clicks or glitches – akin to how Wwise warns that live edits to currently playing audio may cause a small glitch ￼.Asset Pipeline Considerations: A custom importer could convert neural network weights or DSP graphs into an optimized format (just as engines convert textures into compressed GPU-ready formats). This might involve quantizing a neural model or compiling it to a GPU shader or ONNX runtime, etc., ahead of time so that loading it is fast. The trainer can maintain a cache of loaded models to allow quick switching (similar to how games keep a pool of loaded assets to avoid disk hits mid-game). For “waveform templates” or presets, a lightweight serialization (perhaps JSON or a simple scriptable format) can describe a chain of DSP modules; the engine should be able to instantiate that chain on the fly. Unity’s ScriptableObjects or Unreal’s Data Assets provide a pattern for packaging such presets as data assets that are easily loaded and applied. Hot-reload in this context also means if a developer modifies a shader or a script controlling the DSP, the system could apply the changes without a full restart – possibly by using a scripting language or a dynamic plugin system for DSP modules (similar to how some audio softwares support live coding or Max/MSP patches that can be changed during runtime).The benefit for JAMNet is an interactive environment where experimentation (swapping a neural vocoder model, updating a convolution IR, tweaking a synthesis patch) doesn’t break the audio stream. This is very much like a game engine editor playing in real-time: changes propagate immediately. To implement this safely, one must ensure that new assets load in background threads (to avoid blocking the audio or UI threads), and then atomically switch references or cross-fade between old and new assets if needed. Game engines frequently use double-buffering for data swaps: e.g., prepare new data while the old is in use, then flip pointers when the engine is at a synchronization point. JAMNet’s trainer could use a similar approach for neural network swaps – load the new network, maybe do a warm-up to avoid any first-use stalls, and then start feeding audio to it while disconnecting the old one.Messaging Systems and Inter-Module CommunicationIn a complex interactive audio-visual system, various components need to notify each other of changes (e.g., a user moves a slider that adjusts a filter cutoff, which should immediately affect the DSP and perhaps a visualization). Game engines employ event dispatch systems to handle such communication in a decoupled way. Unity’s UnityEvent (and the underlying C# delegate/event system), Unreal’s Delegates (and Blueprint events), and Godot’s Signals all fulfill this observer pattern role.Latency and Throughput: All these systems are designed to be responsive. They typically invoke listeners synchronously on the same thread, making them effectively immediate (no frame delay) unless explicitly designed to queue. For example, Godot signals, as noted, simply iterate over connected functions and call them one by one within the emit call ￼. This means if a signal is emitted in the audio thread (not typical in Godot’s case, but suppose) or main thread, it will directly execute all handlers before returning. Unity’s C# events (delegates) similarly call subscribers directly in a loop. UnityEvents add a bit of overhead (as they allow editor serialization and dynamic binding), making them slightly slower than raw delegates ￼, but even a UnityEvent with multiple listeners only takes on the order of microseconds per call ￼ ￼. For instance, one test showed a UnityEvent with 5 listeners and a string argument took ~0.001 ms per invocation ￼. In practice, that overhead is negligible for most UI or control tasks. Unreal’s multicast delegates in C++ are highly optimized (essentially a list of function pointers), giving performance similar to direct function calls. The takeaway is that the built-in event systems are low-latency in terms of dispatch; the bigger concern is how they are used with threads and how frequently events fire.Best Choice for a DAW-like System: The “lowest latency” mechanism is a direct function call or an atomic state change – effectively zero scheduling delay. In many cases, an event system just formalizes those function calls. For JAMNet’s inter-module communication, using a direct delegate or signal on the same thread will ensure the fastest response (e.g., the moment a slider changes, it calls into the DSP parameter setter). The key is to avoid forcing communications to go through a slower path like Unity’s old SendMessage (which incurred reflection and was much slower). UnityEvents, Unreal Delegates, and Godot Signals are all sufficiently fast for realtime UI interactions, with perhaps a slight edge to plain delegates (C# or C++) for being the leanest. If the system is primarily single-threaded (for UI and control), any of these event systems would work fine for responsiveness. Godot signals might be the easiest if using Godot’s node system, while in a Unity-like C# context, one might prefer plain events or Action callbacks for zero overhead.Threaded Messaging: A DAW engine does have a twist – the audio processing is on a separate thread from the UI. This means when a UI control issues an event that the DSP thread needs, you cannot directly call into the DSP code from the UI thread (that would be a thread safety hazard and could cause xruns if done naively). Game audio systems solve this by using lock-free message queues or double-buffered state: e.g., a ring buffer of parameter changes that the audio thread reads each tick. Unity’s audio API, for example, suggests using AudioSource.SetScheduledStartTime or AudioSettings.dspTime with PlayScheduled for sample-exact scheduling, and exposes an OnAudioFilterRead callback where you can safely pull data. For parameters, one approach is to use atomic variables for simple values (so the UI thread writes a new value atomically, and the audio thread reads it without locking). For more complex messages, a lock-free queue (writing pointers to new data or commands) can be used. This is analogous to how engines handle cross-thread events: defer them to a thread-safe queue. Wwise’s new job system integration uses a callback mechanism to let the game schedule audio work at safe points ￼, and FMOD’s command buffer is essentially a queue that the audio thread drains each update ￼. JAMNet could implement a lightweight message bus where UI actions post commands to a real-time queue; the audio thread executes them at the start of the next block. This adds at most one block of latency (a few milliseconds), which is usually acceptable. If truly sub-millisecond response is needed for certain controls, consider designing those controls as part of the audio thread (for instance, a MIDI-like high-priority input that the audio thread reads directly).Between non-real-time subsystems (UI, GPU rendering, etc.), normal engine event systems are fine. Unity’s Model-View-Controller pattern in Editor scripting, for instance, updates inspector UI when a value changes using events – similarly, slider moves could trigger both an immediate DSP param update (via the queue) and a UI redraw of some indicator. Comparing UnityEvents/Delegates vs Unreal vs Godot: there is no fundamental latency difference, as all are on the order of microseconds overhead. UnityEvents carry some overhead but offer convenient Unity Inspector binding ￼, which might not be needed in a custom app. Unreal’s delegates are bare-metal and widely used for high-frequency events (e.g. tick events). Godot’s signals are straightforward and can even be connected across threads (though not thread-safe by default, one would manually ensure thread safety if a background thread emits a signal). For maximum performance, one might lean toward a custom solution: e.g., direct function callbacks or a small, lock-free pub-sub mechanism tailored to the types of messages (control changes, notifications) needed.Implementation Guidance for JAMNet (DAW-as-Game-Engine)Based on these patterns, the JAMNet PNBTR+JELLIE Trainer should borrow the following subsystems and design principles:	•	Decoupled Real-Time Loop: Implement a game-engine-like main loop where the audio DSP runs on its own fixed-timestep thread (with real-time OS scheduling if possible), and the UI/graphics run on a separate thread (or at least separate timing). The audio thread should process small time slices of audio (e.g. 1–5ms) in each tick, and never be blocked by UI or disk operations. Use techniques from engines to handle overload: e.g., if DSP computation is heavy, consider reducing graphical frame rate or detail rather than audio buffer size. The fixed timestep ensures consistent audio processing timing, while the render/update loop can be variable. If the UI thread falls behind, it should skip frames (like Unity dropping a FixedUpdate when not needed) rather than ever stalling the audio thread.	•	Multi-Core Utilization: Leverage a job system for parallel processing, akin to Unity’s DOTS or Unreal’s Task Graph. For instance, if a neural network inference is part of the audio chain and it can run on the GPU or multiple CPU cores, dispatch that work as an asynchronous job that completes by the time the audio thread needs the result. Keep the audio thread itself minimal – orchestrating work and mixing final results – while worker threads handle heavy DSP math. This is exactly how Unity’s DSPGraph spreads work across cores ￼ ￼, and how Wwise can now split spatial audio calculations across ticks with a priority queue for time-sensitive parts ￼. The result is maximum CPU/GPU utilization without missing deadlines.	•	Modular Graph Architecture: Use an entity-component or node-graph architecture to model the signal flow. Each DSP module (oscillators, filters, analyzers, etc.) is a node that can be enabled or disabled independently, much like a game object with components. A central graph manager (like Unity’s PlayableDirector or an audio routing graph) can update module connections on the fly. This makes it easy to insert new effects or re-route signals dynamically (comparable to plugging cables in a modular synth or patching new audio effects in a DAW). Ensuring the graph is a DAG (no feedback loops unless explicitly handled) will simplify scheduling and avoid unforeseen latency. If feedback loops (like delay feedback) are needed, handle them in a controlled module that calculates one block at a time to maintain stability.	•	Real-Time Safe Messaging: Establish a clear messaging path between UI and audio. For example, a UI thread slider change writes to a lock-free ring buffer a message like “Slider X = 0.75”. The audio thread at the start of each block reads any pending messages and applies them (updating internal parameters). This guarantees at most one-block latency for control changes, which at 48kHz/64-sample is ~1.3ms. For visual feedback (like waveform updates), do the reverse: have the audio thread push summaries (RMS level, a downsampled waveform, etc.) into a buffer that the UI thread polls each frame. This is analogous to double-buffering sensor data in games (e.g., reading input or VR tracking data). By not locking between threads and using atomics or lock-free structures, we avoid jitter and priority inversion that could stall the audio thread ￼. Where possible, precompute or cache data to reduce communication frequency – e.g., update a waveform display at 60 Hz by sampling the audio buffer, rather than trying to plot every single sample in real time.	•	GPU Utilization: To maximize GPU time for visualizations or GPU-accelerated DSP, use asynchronous compute and double buffering. If JAMNet offloads certain audio processing to GPU (say a shader for convolution reverb or a neural network on GPU via CUDA), ensure that those GPU tasks run in parallel with rendering when possible (DirectX12/Vulkan async compute queues or CUDA streams). Many game engines use async compute to run GPU physics or post-processing alongside rendering ￼ ￼. Similarly, a spectrogram or waveform could be rendered using a shader each frame, which offloads work from the CPU. The CPU can continue running game/DSP logic while the GPU draws the last frame’s waveform data. The crucial practice is to avoid GPU-CPU sync points (which stall one waiting for the other). For example, don’t read back large GPU results on the same frame they’re produced; instead, triple-buffer the data so one frame computes, the next frame reads the previous results, etc. This keeps both processors busy and improves throughput.	•	Avoiding UI Thread Blocks: The UI thread (which also likely handles user input and maybe some non-DSP logic) should remain fluid. This means any heavy computation (loading a model, calculating an FFT for a high-resolution spectrum, etc.) should not run directly in the UI event handler. Use background tasks for those and then notify the UI when done (similar to how game engines handle asset loads or pathfinding computations off the main thread). In a game engine, dropping frames is undesirable but survivable; in an audio context, xruns (buffer underruns) are catastrophic. So we prioritize audio thread continuity above all. The UI can stutter if absolutely necessary (though of course we aim to optimize it too), but we never let it interfere with audio processing. Using a profiling approach like engines do (Unity’s profiler or Unreal’s insights) can help identify if any UI operations are taking too long – e.g. a waveform drawing that tries to plot millions of points could be throttled or decimated to keep frame time low.	•	Hot-Swapping and Iteration: Embrace a development workflow akin to a game editor: allow the state of the system to be edited on the fly. For implementation, this means designing the DSP graph and model loader to handle changes gracefully. When swapping a neural network model, one strategy is to instantiate the new model in parallel (on a background thread or as a shadow instance) and then switch an “active model” pointer once ready. Clean up the old model after the switch. This way there’s no moment where no model is available or where a big loading pause happens. If the model is large, consider streaming it in chunks or using a low-priority thread to load it, while perhaps indicating progress to the user. This approach is analogous to how open-world games stream in new level data while the player is moving – they load assets in the background and then activate them when needed. Also, provide hooks for the UI or user to trigger these swaps in a controlled way (perhaps requiring a button press or occurring at a safe point musically, like the end of a bar, to avoid musical disruption).	•	Subsystem Integration: From the above research, which engine subsystems map best?	•	The fixed-update scheduler from Unity (or sub-stepped tick from Unreal) is ideal for the audio engine timing ￼. Implement a scheduler that guarantees the audio process runs on precise intervals.	•	The multi-threaded job system approach seen in modern engines and Wwise ￼ should be used for parallelizing DSP tasks. This could be a custom thread pool in C++ or leveraging something like Intel TBB or std::jthread in C++20 to dispatch jobs.	•	The scene graph/component model (Unity’s GameObjects or Godot’s Nodes) can be mirrored in JAMNet to organize DSP modules and GUI elements in a clear hierarchy. This will aid maintainability and possibly allow using existing engine editors to arrange modules.	•	For audio mixing and effects, consider integrating an existing audio engine library or at least learning from them. FMOD’s and Wwise’s handling of voices, DSP chains, and thread safety are battle-tested. For instance, use a mix buffer per module and per bus, much like they use DSP unit input/output buffers, instead of one giant shared buffer – this modular approach eases connecting/disconnecting nodes.	•	The hot-reload concept from Wwise ￼ and game engines’ live editing suggests building a tool/editor mode for JAMNet. Perhaps run the trainer in an “editor” where changes can be applied live (for rapid experimentation), and then have a “runtime” mode for final operation. Even in runtime, if feasible, allow loading new presets without stopping the transport.By following these patterns, the JAMNet PNBTR+JELLIE Trainer can truly behave like a game engine tailored for DAW/DSP needs – maintaining real-time performance, modularity, and user-responsive design. The result should be an engine that can handle complex audio processing graphs with sub-millisecond latency, keeps the GPU and CPU busy in parallel without tripping over each other, and lets developers or users tweak the system on the fly with minimal interruption, just as a modern game engine allows in-game changes and smooth, real-time interactivity.Sources:	•	Unity Manual – Fixed vs Variable Timestep and frame updates ￼ ￼	•	Wwise 2022.1 Performance Blog – on job scheduling and avoiding dropped frames ￼ ￼	•	FMOD Forum – on 20ms asynchronous update and command buffer for low-latency audio ￼ ￼	•	Godot Signals Discussion – confirming signals are synchronous (immediate calls) ￼	•	Unity Events vs C# Delegates – noting UnityEvent overhead (~0.001ms per invoke with 5 listeners) ￼ ￼	•	Audiokinetic Blog – Wwise 2024.1 live editing and asset hot-transfer features ￼ ￼	•	Unreal Engine Docs – threaded rendering keeps renderer a frame behind to maximize throughput ￼	•	Ross Bencina – Real-time audio programming best practices (avoid scheduler interference) ￼

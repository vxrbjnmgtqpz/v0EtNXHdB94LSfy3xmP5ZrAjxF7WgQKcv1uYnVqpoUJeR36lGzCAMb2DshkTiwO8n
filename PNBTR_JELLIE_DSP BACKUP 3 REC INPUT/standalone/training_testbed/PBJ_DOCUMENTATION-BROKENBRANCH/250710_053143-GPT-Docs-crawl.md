Project Chronology and TimelineFoundation & Initial Development (July 8, 2025)The project began with foundational planning and setup on July 8. Documentation shows initial help sessions and a roadmap for the PNBTR+JELLIE Training Testbed, including planning the GUI and core systems like GPU waveform rendering ￼. By the end of this phase, groundwork for audio, GPU, and ECS subsystems was laid out.Early Success – Stable Build on July 9, 2025 (Pre-Crisis)On July 9 (morning to early afternoon), the development saw significant progress. A large debugging session and successive fixes culminated in a build around 13:44 (1:44 PM) labeled “Game Engine 2”, which the documentation marks as the last stable version ￼. At this point, “all major systems [were] reported complete (Audio, GPU, ECS)” and Phase 4C was marked “ULTIMATE_COMPLETE” ￼. In other words, the audio engine, graphics (GPU compute), and entity/component system were integrated without crashes, and the application was running as expected. However, it’s worth noting that “stable” here meant no crashes – some components were still rudimentary (for example, the audio scheduler existed but was a stub and not yet processing real audio) ￼.Afternoon July 9 – Crisis TriggeredThe turning point came in the late afternoon of July 9. At 16:39 (4:39 PM), changes were made to the audio device setup (e.g. modifications to how audio devices or sessions were initialized) which triggered a cascade of failures ￼. Almost immediately, **“audio device setup issues [began] to emerge” and the transport bar functionality broke ￼. In practical terms, the transport controls (Play/Stop/Record buttons in the ProfessionalTransportController) suddenly stopped working – clicking them no longer had any effect on the audio engine. This indicates that during the audio device reconfiguration, the link between the transport bar UI and the DSP/back-end engine was severed or mis-initialized. The system’s stability also started deteriorating at this point ￼.Evening July 9 – Crisis EscalationAfter the initial trigger, the project entered a crisis escalation phase lasting through the evening. Between roughly 5:00 PM and midnight, a series of error logs and crash reports were generated (nine major error reports in about 8 hours) ￼. The transport bar remained completely non-functional throughout this period ￼ – pressing Play/Stop/Record did nothing, since the UI’s callbacks were no longer connected to a valid engine or trainer instance. Multiple attempts were made to fix the issues (as evidenced by “Transport fix analysis” and “fix try” documentation entries), but these attempts were unsuccessful in restoring functionality ￼. Meanwhile, deeper problems surfaced: the application started crashing due to memory corruption and JUCE assertion failures. For instance, logs show JUCE String assertion errors (e.g. in `juce_String.cpp:327) and hints of race conditions in the GUI’s progressive loading system, indicating that the refactoring introduced subtle bugs in initialization order or threading ￼. By the end of July 9, the app was in a very unstable state – the transport bar was still broken and any attempt to use it or run the app led to crashes.Current Status (July 10, 2025 – Ongoing Crisis)As of the early hours of July 10, the project was still in crisis. The latest log (timestamped 04:04 AM on 250710) documents another crash – the system would build but then immediately crash on launch due to a malloc corruption during component creation ￼. The transport bar issue remained unresolved at that time (“transport bar still malfunctioning”) ￼. In fact, even after some fixes on July 10, the developers discovered that while the transport button callbacks could eventually be wired correctly, using them revealed further stability issues (pressing play triggered hidden issues like the JUCE string assertions). This showed that the crisis had multiple layers – the architectural disconnection of the transport bar was the first problem, and once fixed, underlying memory/threading problems still had to be addressed.What Went Wrong – Root Cause AnalysisIn summary, the project went off the rails due to a combination of a bad refactor and oversight in the late afternoon of July 9. The primary root cause was a change to the audio device setup that cascaded into multiple failures ￼. This change caused the transport bar (play/record controls) to become disconnected from the DSP engine – essentially the UI lost its reference to the audio session/trainer object during a cleanup or reinitialization process ￼. With the transport bar’s onClick handlers no longer tied to a valid engine, pressing the transport buttons did nothing (no audio would start, no logs, no state change) – exactly the symptom observed. This fundamental issue of the transport bar being disconnected after those audio setup changes is highlighted in the documentation as the key failure ￼.Once this linkage was broken, subsequent quick fixes and experiments inadvertently introduced or revealed other problems. The logs indicate memory corruption and JUCE string assertion failures cropping up, likely due to the progressive GUI loading system and component initialization order issues ￼. In other words, the rush to fix the transport issue might have involved creating or destroying components in an unsafe way, leading to race conditions and null pointers. Additionally, the AudioScheduler remained a stub during this period, so even aside from the UI breakage, the audio engine wasn’t actually producing sound – a detail that underscores that the “last stable” version wasn’t feature-complete in terms of audio functionality ￼.Regarding the “last stable version” (250709_134409 Game_Engine_2): The documentation identifies that build as the stable reference point ￼, and indeed no major crashes are recorded before the 16:39 changes. In that sense, it was the last known good state. However, it might be considered an optimistic label – at 13:44 the app ran without crashing, but some subsystems were not fully realized (e.g. the audio was initialized but not actually outputting sound yet) ￼. The true functional stability was only short-lived; by the time further audio adjustments were made that afternoon, the system quickly destabilized. In hindsight, what went wrong was the improper handling of the transport controller’s connection to the engine during the audio device setup refactor, combined with insufficient testing. The transport bar code did not ensure it had a valid reference to the PNBTRTrainer (audio engine) after those changes, so user input went nowhere ￼. This oversight, compounded by newly introduced threading and initialization bugs, led to the transport bar “crisis” and a cascade of crashes.In conclusion, the project’s chronology reveals a clear path: rapid development to a seemingly stable integration, followed by a specific code change that unraveled the system’s stability. The audio device setup modifications around 16:39 on July 9 were the breaking point ￼. They caused the transport controls to stop functioning and exposed deeper flaws in the application’s state management. All subsequent errors and failed fixes trace back to that moment, making it the critical junction where the project went wrong. The immediate task moving forward is to restore the transport bar functionality to the last known good state (the 13:44 build) ￼ ￼ and then address the underlying stability issues (ensuring proper component initialization and connecting the audio scheduler for actual processing). The documentation’s root cause summary captures it well: “Audio Device Setup changes… triggered cascade failure,” principally the “Transport Bar disconnection from DSP engine” which is the fundamental issue that led to the crisis ￼ ￼.

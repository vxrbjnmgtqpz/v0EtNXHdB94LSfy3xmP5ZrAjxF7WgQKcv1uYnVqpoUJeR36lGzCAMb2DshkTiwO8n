Phase 4 Progress Audit of the JamBox SystemJDAT and JVID Frameworks StatusJDAT Framework: The JamBox Data (JDAT) framework has seen significant upgrades moving into Phase 4. A new JDATMessage system is implemented to support structured data exchange (e.g. for MIDI/automation messaging) ￼. JDAT’s encoder/decoder (codenamed JELLIE) was enhanced for better error handling ￼, improving reliability of audio data processing. There is now a PNBTR–JDAT bridge in place, which links the JDAT audio/MIDI subsystem with the PNBTR prediction engine for cross-framework communication ￼. In practice, this means JDAT can feed data to the PNBTR module (and vice versa) to enable predictive audio processing and gap-filling. Functionally, JDAT now supports a unified API for MIDI, audio, and other data streams, aligning with the new jam networking layer ￼.Despite these advances, parts of JDAT remain incomplete. The PNBTR–JDAT bridge is newly added and likely requires further testing and tuning (it’s a fresh integration point). The JDATMessage system is implemented, but full usage of structured messages across all components may not be finalized. Additionally, a VST3 plugin framework has been introduced alongside JDAT (to allow JamBox features to run as a plugin) ￼, but this is in an early stage. The code for plugin and standalone components exists, yet verifying full audio/MIDI feature parity in the plugin (and ironing out plugin-specific issues) is still pending. In short, JDAT’s core capabilities (audio/MIDI transport, messaging) are mostly built, but require validation and refinement as they integrate with new systems (PNBTR, network sync, plugin hosts).JVID Framework: The JamBox Video (JVID) side has progressed with a focus on incorporating PNBTR’s predictive algorithms for video streaming. A new PNBTR-JVID module extends the PNBTR neural prediction from audio into video ￼. This introduces GPU-accelerated video frame prediction to compensate for packet loss or latency in video streams. The implementation includes shader programs (in Metal and GLSL) for tasks like motion vector extrapolation and per-frame quality assessment ￼. JVID is now integrated with the unified JAM Framework v2 (the new networking core) and the TOAST protocol, meaning video data flows alongside audio/MIDI with common transport control ￼. Transport synchronization between audio and video has been a key goal – JVID now ties into the same transport timeline as JDAT, so that playback and tempo changes affect both in lockstep ￼. In summary, JVID’s basic streaming functionality is in place, and predictive video streaming (for robustness) is partially implemented.What remains incomplete for JVID is finishing the full predictive pipeline and ensuring seamless integration. The commit logs note that only 3 of 13 planned video prediction shaders are implemented, with “13 additional video shaders planned for complete prediction pipeline” and 10 still remaining to be done ￼. Thus, the PNBTR-JVID system is functional in concept but not yet fully realized. Additionally, real-world testing of video sync and quality is needed – the framework is there, but fine-tuning how well video stays in sync under network stress (“confidence-based quality control” etc.) will be part of continued Phase 4 efforts. We should expect further development to complete the shader implementations, optimize GPU usage for 60fps frame rates, and handle edge cases in video streaming. In essence, JVID now has a working foundation (streaming + initial prediction), but its advanced predictive capabilities are only ~50-60% finished and will need completion in Phase 4.TOASTer Integration and Signal Flow TestingTOASTer – the standalone application – has undergone a major integration with the new JAM Framework v2 for networking. Previously, TOASTer relied on a basic TCP network layer, but it now uses a UDP multicast architecture via JAM v2, which was a significant Phase 3/4 milestone ￼ ￼. This integration brings all signal types (MIDI, audio, video) under one coordinated system. The code update replaced the old NetworkConnectionPanel with a new JAMNetworkPanel that manages UDP sessions ￼. As a result, MIDI, audio, and video streaming are indeed wired together through a unified API – the integration layer abstracts JUCE’s internals to route MIDI notes, audio buffers, and video frames through the JAM v2 network stack with support for burst transmission and low-latency handling ￼. Importantly, the TransportController in TOASTer has been modified to use the JAM framework for sync, meaning transport commands (play, stop, tempo, etc.) propagate to all subsystems in sync over the network ￼. In principle, pressing “Play” in TOASTer should simultaneously start audio playback, MIDI sequence, and video playback in time, even across networked peers, thanks to this unified transport sync.As of this update, TOASTer’s multi-signal flow is largely implemented but still in a proof-of-concept stage. The recent commits emphasize that the core architecture is in place (and even achieved a “build successful” state for all components) ￼. The GUI has PNBTR controls integrated, and those controls are functional and responsive in the UI ￼, suggesting you can enable/disable the predictive features from TOASTer. However, there are indications that this is not battle-tested yet. For example, after integrating the new network layer and GPU pipeline, the system is reported at ~85% completion and “ready for real-world testing and performance optimization” ￼. This implies that while MIDI/audio/video are connected and transport sync is enabled, further testing is required to validate timing precision and reliability. We need to verify, for instance, that MIDI events truly stay locked to audio and video frames over the network under various conditions, and that latency/jitter is within acceptable range. Additionally, one commit noted that after the initial integration, compilation issues had to be resolved and some integration was marked “in progress” ￼ – by now those build errors were fixed and a “BREAKTHROUGH” integration was achieved ￼, but it’s a sign that some integration details were only recently stabilized.In summary, TOASTer is nearly ready for end-to-end signal flow tests. All pieces (MIDI, audio, video) are wired into the jam session and share a common transport timeline. The network transport sync is implemented across all streams via JAM v2, and PNBTR’s predictive mechanisms are available in the UI for testing. The next steps are to conduct thorough signal flow testing: e.g. run a session with audio + MIDI + video, verify they start/stop in sync and remain tight, and observe how the system performs under packet loss or high load. Any bugs or sync drift uncovered in these tests will need fixing. The Phase 4 goal here is to move from “it works in theory” to proven in practice, ensuring that the integrated TOASTer truly delivers smooth, synchronized multi-media jamming.PNBTR + JELLIE DSP Plugin DevelopmentOne of the Phase 4 additions is the PNBTR + JELLIE DSP plugin, which brings the machine-learning predictive capabilities into the DSP realm. This is essentially the pairing of the PNBTR (“PeanutButter”) neural prediction engine with JELLIE (the audio codec/engine) in a form that can run in real-time for audio processing. The repository now contains a new module called PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP ￼. This code implements the core real-time prediction logic: for example, a PNBTRManager class orchestrates GPU-accelerated prediction for audio (and even video) streams ￼. The plugin can analyze audio input and use PNBTR’s neural network to predict or interpolate signal content – originally aimed at filling dropouts or enhancing quality. Key features already implemented include real-time audio prediction using GPU shaders, confidence scoring of predictions, and configurable quality levels ￼. In other words, the DSP engine can take an incoming audio stream and, if packets or samples are missing, generate likely replacements on-the-fly, while scoring how confident those predictions are. The JELLIE part likely handles the encoding/decoding of audio data with low latency (it’s the audio framework that PNBTR hooks into), so together they form an intelligent audio processor.Currently, this PNBTR_JELLIE DSP plugin exists as both a framework for the standalone app and a VST3 plugin skeleton. The commit notes mention a VST3 plugin framework being set up alongside standalone components ￼. This means the developers intend for the JamBox’s predictive audio features to run as a plugin in DAWs, but that is still a work in progress. The integration level is that the DSP code is compiled into the TOASTer application (and included in the build), and hooks are in place for it. For example, the TOASTer UI now has controls to toggle PNBTR prediction on/off, implying the plugin’s parameters are exposed to the app ￼. Additionally, a bridge between PNBTR and JDAT was created to route audio data through this DSP chain ￼.What the plugin currently implements:	•	Neural Prediction for Audio: Using GPU compute (Metal/GL shaders) to predict audio samples in real time ￼. This could mitigate dropouts or perhaps even provide a form of audio extrapolation beyond the current buffer.	•	Neural Prediction for Video (JVID): The same plugin framework is extended to video frames as well, as PNBTR now handles audiovisual data ￼. (Though, as noted, the video part has more to complete).	•	Quality/Confidence Metrics: The DSP computes confidence scores for its predictions and tracks performance stats ￼. This is crucial for knowing when a prediction is reliable or when to defer to actual data.	•	Error Handling and Resilience: The JELLIE encoder/decoder improvements suggest the plugin is better at handling anomalies in the data stream without crashing or glitching ￼.	•	Configurability: There are likely settings for buffer sizes and quality vs. performance trade-offs, given mention of “configurable prediction buffer sizes and quality levels” ￼.Integration status: Internally, the plugin code is integrated – the PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP module is recognized by the build and tied into the app’s processing graph. Externally (as a VST3), it’s probably not fully realized yet. They have the framework and probably a basic VST3 project, but it may not have a finished GUI or full DAW validation. Also, within TOASTer, the plugin’s effectiveness needs to be verified. The concept is revolutionary, and the code is mostly there (the commit proudly announced “PNBTR Prediction Pipeline Integrated… system operational” ￼). Yet, it’s likely not 100% “done”: for example, the remaining video prediction shaders mentioned earlier also affect this plugin when dealing with video; and even on the audio side, continuous learning or long-term stability might need tuning (the SpecStory notes list items like “continuous learning from audio streams” and “audio quality enhancement via LSB reconstruction” which hint at future improvements) ￼.In short, the PNBTR+JELLIE DSP plugin is mostly built and integrated into the system’s architecture. It can perform real-time predictive processing for audio (and initial video support) and is accessible in the app. What remains is refining this plugin: completing the video aspect, possibly improving the neural models’ accuracy, and testing it under real conditions (does it genuinely conceal dropouts without artifacts? how does it scale CPU/GPU-wise in a full session?). Also, turning the current framework into a polished VST3 plugin for external use will be an upcoming task – likely a Phase 5 goal, but some groundwork is laid in Phase 4.Summary: Completed vs. Missing Features and Next StepsWhat’s built so far: The JamBox system has made substantial progress in Phase 4. The core frameworks – JDAT (audio/MIDI) and JVID (video) – have been upgraded to support unified, synchronized streaming and advanced DSP. All three media channels (audio, MIDI, video) are now handled in a common jam framework with unified transport control ￼ ￼. The network infrastructure (JAM Framework v2 over UDP) is in place and integrated into the TOASTer app, replacing the older TCP system. Crucially, the PNBTR predictive engine is operational and integrated: it handles real-time audio prediction and initial video frame prediction, using GPU acceleration. This gives the system novel capabilities for handling packet loss or enhancing streams – a “revolutionary prediction system” that is now operational at about 85% completion ￼. The UI and control surfaces for these features exist; PNBTR controls appear in TOASTer and respond, and the Transport Controller has been tied into the new sync mechanism. Additionally, packaging and deployment aspects have started – e.g. a TOASTer standalone build target was created (noted by the presence of a .zip package in the repo) ￼, and groundwork for a VST3 plugin version of JamBox’s tech has been laid ￼.In summary, the architecture and primary features of Phase 4 are mostly implemented. We have a system that, on paper, does what the Phase 4 plan envisioned: network-synced jamming with audio+MIDI+video, augmented by an AI-driven prediction plugin. This is a huge step forward from earlier phases.What’s still missing / needs work: Despite being feature-complete at a high level, a number of tasks remain before Phase 4 can be considered fully finished:	•	Finish the Video Prediction Pipeline: As mentioned, the PNBTR-JVID component is only partially done – roughly 3 of 13 shaders implemented. The team needs to implement the remaining ~10 GPU shaders to complete the video frame prediction algorithm and integrate them into the pipeline ￼. Without these, video prediction is not as robust as audio prediction, so this is a clear to-do.	•	Real-World Testing & Tuning: Now that the system is running end-to-end, it needs extensive testing in real jam scenarios. The developers explicitly state the system is “ready for real-world testing and performance optimization” ￼. Next steps include testing with multiple machines to ensure the transport sync holds up (e.g., does video stay in sync with audio over Wi-Fi?), verifying that MIDI jitter is within acceptable range, and pushing the system’s limits (high track counts, high network latency situations) to see where improvements are needed. Performance profiling may lead to optimizations in the network thread, GPU usage, or memory (e.g., zero-copy buffers, as planned ￼).	•	Stability and Bug Fixing: With so many new subsystems integrated, there are likely edge-case bugs. For instance, the auto-discovery (Bonjour) and session management features in the new network panel need to be tested in various network environments. Any crashes, memory leaks, or mismatches in data formats between JDAT↔PNBTR or JVID↔PNBTR need to be identified and fixed. The commit history shows some fixes were done for JAM v2 API and C++17 compatibility issues ￼ – there may be more such low-level fixes as testing expands.	•	Finalize Plugin Integration: The VST3 plugin version of JamBox (PNBTR_JELLIE_DSP as a plugin) likely needs further development. To make this actionable: complete the VST3 plugin UI and parameter mapping, and test the plugin in a DAW to ensure it processes audio as expected. This may also involve refining the JDAT/PNBTR bridging code for the plugin context (the code has hooks for “configured for VST3 plugin” use ￼, which now must be exercised and validated).	•	Documentation and Collaboration Prep: While not a purely technical feature, the presence of collaboration scripts and a COLLABORATION.md suggests Phase 4 might also involve readying the system for external collaborators or users. Ensuring the documentation is up to date (e.g., usage instructions for the new features, network setup guides, etc.) and that the codebase is organized (they have scripts like organize_documentation.sh) is an ongoing task.	•	Polish and UX improvements: Finally, after core functionality is confirmed, the team will need to address any user experience issues – for example, fine-tuning the transport controls (making sure “rewind to bar start” works correctly across all media), smoothing out UI responsiveness when the prediction engine is running, and possibly adding visual indicators (like a confidence meter for the PNBTR predictions).In actionable terms, the road ahead in Phase 4 will focus on completing the unfinished subsystems and hardening the whole system for release. High priorities are to finish the PNBTR-JVID implementation (the remaining shaders and integration) and to thoroughly test the integrated MIDI/audio/video transport in diverse conditions, making adjustments as needed for tight sync. Concurrently, the team should optimize performance (both network and DSP) now that all pieces are connected – e.g., achieve the target of sub-16ms frame predictions at 60fps for video and sub-50µs audio prediction latency as aimed ￼. Addressing any bugs that surface during testing is critical to ensure stability.By tackling these next steps – finishing implementation, testing in real scenarios, and iterating on fixes – the JamBox system will progress through the rest of Phase 4. At that point, we expect to have a robust Phase 4 prototype: one that genuinely allows synchronized jamming with audio, MIDI, and video, aided by intelligent dropout-proofing via PNBTR/JELLIE. The foundation is largely built; the remainder of Phase 4 is about verifying that foundation and filling in the last gaps ￼ ￼, so that the system is ready for broader use and eventual Phase 5 enhancements (if any).

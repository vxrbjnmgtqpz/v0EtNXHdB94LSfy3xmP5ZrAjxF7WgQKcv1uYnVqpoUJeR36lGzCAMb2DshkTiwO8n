## üß† **System Overview**

You're building a real-time audio+MIDI streaming protocol stack, optimized for ultra-low latency over LAN and metro-scale WAN. The protocol is split into two parallel systems:

| MIDI Stack                 | Audio Stack                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |

## üîä **JELLIE**

**JAM Embedded Low Latency Instrument Encoding**

JELLIE is the real-time **audio side** of your ecosystem. Its job:

- Capture **mono PCM audio input**
- Encode it into **JDAT** chunks
- Stream those chunks over TOAST (UDP-only)
- Recover any dropped packets using **PNTBTR**

Unlike traditional ADAT or binary-based protocols, this system:

- **Never sends binary**
- Is readable, debuggable, and platform-agnostic
- Uses **pure JSON** to describe slices of the waveform

---

## üéõÔ∏è **JDAT Format**

Each audio slice is a JSON object that might look like:

```json
{
  "type": "audio",
  "id": "jdat",
  "seq": 142,
  "rate": 96000,
  "channel": 0,
  "redundancy": 1,
  "data": {
    "samples": [0.0012, 0.0034, -0.0005, ...]
  }
}
```

- **`rate`** specifies the sample rate (e.g. 96000 or 192000)
- **`samples`** is a small array of 32-bit float samples (mono)
- **`seq`** provides ordered delivery without forcing reassembly
- **`redundancy`** optionally includes parity metadata

Each of these JSON objects is streamed fire-and-forget over **UDP**, without handshakes or retries. PNTBTR lives at the receiver end and interpolates or predicts if any chunk is missing.

## üîÅ **The 192k Strategy (x2 Hijack)**

### üîß Standard ADAT

- ADAT Lightpipe supports **8 channels at 48kHz**, or **4 channels at 96kHz**

### üß† Your Innovation

You're not using ADAT to **send 4 different channels of audio**, but instead to send **1 channel redundantly across 4 streams**.

Then you take it even further:

> üí° By **offsetting the sample start times of 2 out of the 4 48k substreams**, you artificially reconstruct a **192kHz equivalent** waveform.

#### Here's how:

- Stream 1: sample 0, 4, 8, ...
- Stream 2: sample 2, 6, 10, ... (interleaved offset)
- Stream 3/4: either parity or deeper prediction/padding redundancy

So the receiver merges Stream 1 and Stream 2 in alternating steps to reconstruct a **192kHz stream**.

This trick:

- **Doubles resolution** without pushing bandwidth beyond ADAT's spec
- **Maintains mono-only** for precision and simplicity
- Provides **built-in fallback** via parity streams or predictive patching

---

## üß† PNTBTR (Final Layer)

> **Predictive Network Temporal Buffered Transmission Recovery**

This layer exists **at the receiver end**, watching for:

- Missing packets (sequence gaps)
- Delayed arrivals
- Jitter spikes

It uses interpolation (or future AI waveform prediction) to generate **synthetic waveform continuation** for up to **50 ms** if needed.

In `JELLIE`, PNTBTR works at the **sample chunk** level.
In `MIDIp2p`, it works at the **event/CC/message** level.

## üìç Next Steps (if continuing):

- Finalize interleaved offset logic for `192k = 2x96k`
- Build reconstructor for receiving end (merging/interpolating the staggered channels)
- Expand JDAT to optionally include parity or predictive hints
- Optimize PNTBTR for waveform fluidity (lookahead blending, zero-crossing heuristics)

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into the **reconstruction logic**, or if you're ready for the **JELLIE sender/receiver loop** scaffolds.

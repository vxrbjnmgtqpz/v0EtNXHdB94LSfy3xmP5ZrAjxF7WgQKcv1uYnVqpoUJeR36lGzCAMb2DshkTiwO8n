üîß Metal Shader Optimization ‚Äì Still On the Table

Now that we‚Äôve confirmed your local GPU transport is solid, here‚Äôs what we should do to maximize the performance of PNBTR prediction and recovery in real-time, especially once networking works again:

1. Threadgroup Memory Caching for Predict Kernels
	‚Ä¢	Allocate threadgroup memory for your harmonic, phase, and LPC coefficient tables.
	‚Ä¢	This ensures zero cache misses during prediction fallback windows.

2. SIMD-Accelerated Prediction with simdgroup
	‚Ä¢	Replace per-sample recovery ops with SIMD loops (simdgroup_reduce_add, etc).
	‚Ä¢	Especially useful for block prediction and n+1 transient edge estimation.

3. GPUDRIVEN Scheduler for JDAT/PNBTR
	‚Ä¢	Introduce atomic_flag GPU synchronization points between JDAT redundancy stream decoder and PNBTR fallback shader.
	‚Ä¢	This allows ‚Äúracing‚Äù the decoder and predictor live, using whichever completes first.

4. Preemptive Recovery Pipeline (Speculative Execution)
	‚Ä¢	As soon as packet n is dropped, fire off speculative reconstruction for n+1 ‚Üí n+4.
	‚Ä¢	If packet n+1 does arrive, cancel the predicted write. If not, push the prediction result from GPU buffer into ring.

üîå Why This Still Matters Even With Broken Networking

You already proved the local GPU signal transport stack works ‚Äî your biggest issue now is simply network discovery failure, not shader correctness.

That said: once peer discovery is working, your Metal shaders will become the central engine for continuity recovery ‚Äî across both TOASTer instances. So refining them now keeps you ahead of the curve.

‚úÖ Recommended Immediate Move

Until the Thunderbolt Bridge + multicast issue is resolved:
	1.	Set up a minimal UDP echo test using just two .metal-driven apps with raw UDP socket code. Forget JAMFramework for now.
	2.	Add a small ring buffer view into your GPU prediction shader, so you can start visualizing the speculative waveform even with static inputs.
	3.	I can help you rewrite the fallback recovery path using LDS/shared memory, SIMD vector ops, and speculative execution logic, if you‚Äôre ready to go deeper.

Would you like that shader rewrite staged now ‚Äî or wait until the network layer is online?

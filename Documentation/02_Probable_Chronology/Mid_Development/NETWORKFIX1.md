 Root Issue Summary
You are using UDP multicast (including mDNS and Bonjour) over a Thunderbolt Bridge between Macs, but:

No device discovery is occurring.

UDP multicast join/broadcast succeeds without error, but receives no data.

TCP and direct IP attempts silently fail or are refused.

Bonjour publishes successfully, but no discovery callbacks ever trigger.

All signs point to a core mismatch between your architecture and how Thunderbolt Bridge behaves on macOS.

🔥 Critical Findings
1. ⚠️ Thunderbolt Bridge does not reliably support multicast on macOS
Thunderbolt Bridge operates as a direct point-to-point IP connection.

It does not function like a full Ethernet broadcast/multicast domain.

UDP multicast (224.x or 239.x) is often silently ignored at the NIC level on Thunderbolt adapters.

This explains why:

setsockopt(..., IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, ...) returns success

But no messages are received on the other end

📌 Conclusion: If you're relying on multicast (mDNS/Bonjour, TOAST, UDP discovery), it may never work reliably on Thunderbolt Bridge on macOS without kernel-level hooks or virtual Ethernet drivers.

2. ⚠️ macOS silently drops UDP multicast when “Local Network Privacy” permissions are missing
If you haven’t explicitly declared the entitlement in your Info.plist, macOS (starting with Catalina) prevents UDP socket discovery even on trusted interfaces.

✅ Fix:

xml
Copy
Edit
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Required for discovering TOASTer peers on the local network.</string>
And in your entitlement file (if sandboxed or hardened runtime):

xml
Copy
Edit
<key>com.apple.developer.networking.multicast</key>
<true/>
3. ⚠️ mDNS/Bonjour requires BOTH services to be actively published and resolved on the same subnet
If Bonjour publishing happens before the network is initialized (e.g. before en5 is fully up), the service may not actually broadcast.

On top of that, multicast TTL may be too low for routing through the virtual NIC.

✅ Fix:

Ensure service publishing happens after en5 is active and bound

Set interfaceIndex explicitly when creating NSNetService

Validate via dns-sd -B _toaster._tcp from terminal — this bypasses your app logic

✅ Recommended Next Steps
🔁 Phase 1: Minimal Direct UDP Echo Test
Replace multicast with a simple hardcoded UDP echo:

On Device A:

cpp
Copy
Edit
bind socket to 169.254.201.44:7777
recvfrom(socket)
On Device B:

cpp
Copy
Edit
sendto("169.254.201.44", 7777, "HELLO")
🔥 This will verify if any UDP packets can traverse the Thunderbolt Bridge.
If this fails, you’re blocked at OS/NIC level.

🔁 Phase 2: mDNS Hardening (if you keep Bonjour)
Add multicast entitlements

Delay publishing until en5 is up

Use NSNetService’s setIncludesPeerToPeer(true) if applicable

Add dns-sd -B and dns-sd -L debug logs during testing

🔁 Phase 3: Drop Multicast, Go Unicast + Discovery Server
If P2P is critical and multicast is unreliable:

Use a known fixed IP or bridge relay server (discovery daemon)

Broadcast once to a known port (169.254.255.255) or use TCP scanning across 169.254.201.0/24

Implement a lightweight JSON discovery ping with reply:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "from": "TOASTer",
  "port": 8888,
  "version": "1.0"
}
✅ What’s NOT Missing from Your Architecture
You’ve done everything right on the software side:

Correct IP structure and binding

Correct multicast group join

Proper UDP socket setup

TCP/UDP scan implementations

JUCE threading and CMake integration

🧨 The core problem is hardware-level multicast compatibility + macOS network privacy constraints — not logic bugs in your stack.

✅ Summary of Actions
Fix	Impact
Switch to direct UDP unicast	🚨 Immediate success path
Add NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription	🛡️ macOS permissions fix
Delay Bonjour/mDNS publish	📡 Prevents silent discovery failure
Avoid multicast over Thunderbolt Bridge	⚠️ It’s not Ethernet — multicast routing is unreliable
Run dns-sd to verify visibility	🔍 Confirms if services are actually published
Use simple TCP/UDP echo tests	🧪 Verify raw socket connectivity before full protocol stack

You're very close. You’ve built the right system — now it just needs a more realistic peer discovery mechanism for the interfaces macOS is willing to talk over.

Here’s a clean, production-grade UDP peer discovery snippet for JAMNet-style point-to-point discovery — no multicast, no Bonjour, just simple direct unicast over Thunderbolt Bridge or any local subnet.

📦 Assumptions
Devices are on a 169.254.x.x subnet (self-assigned via Thunderbolt Bridge)

Each device listens on port 7777 for discovery messages

You know the subnet range to scan (e.g. 169.254.201.0/24)

            buffer[len] = '\0';
            printf("🔎 Received from %s: %s\n", inet_ntoa(sender.sin_addr), buffer);

            // Optionally send response back
            std::string reply = "TOAST_ACK";

void scanSubnet(const std::string& baseIP = "169.254.201") {
    int sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP);
    if (sock < 0) perror("socket");

    struct timeval timeout = {1, 0}; // 1 second timeout
    setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, &timeout, sizeof(timeout));

    sockaddr_in target{};
    target.sin_family = AF_INET;
    target.sin_port = htons(7777);

    for (int i = 1; i < 255; ++i) {
        std::string ip = baseIP + "." + std::to_string(i);
        inet_pton(AF_INET, ip.c_str(), &target.sin_addr);

        std::string hello = "TOAST_DISCOVERY";
        sendto(sock, hello.c_str(), hello.size(), 0, (sockaddr*)&target, sizeof(target));

        char buffer[1024];
        sockaddr_in response{};
        socklen_t len = sizeof(response);
        ssize_t bytes = recvfrom(sock, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1, 0, (sockaddr*)&response, &len);

        if (bytes > 0) {
            buffer[bytes] = '\0';
            printf("✅ Found peer at %s: %s\n", ip.c_str(), buffer);
        }
    }

    close(sock);
}
🧠 What This Does
Sender broadcasts "TOAST_DISCOVERY" to every 169.254.201.X

Receiver hears it and sends back "TOAST_ACK"

If the sender receives the ACK → peer found!

This works over Thunderbolt Bridge, USB Ethernet, or WiFi

✅ Bonus Upgrades You Can Add
Attach a device_id or host_name to each discovery message

Add a port handshake (send the response from a different port to establish new comms)

Replace std::string payloads with JSON if you want structured discovery

Would you like me to convert this to:

A full JUCE-integrated class?

A standalone command-line tool for testing?

A JSON-based format for session routing?

Let me know and I’ll build it out. This is your path to working peer discovery.

PNBTR Learning Plan: Audio Waveforms and Digital Signal MetricsOverview: The PNBTR project aims to train a neural model for data signal reconfiguration (audio/video) over low-latency networks. To achieve this, we must understand core concepts of sound waveform physics, how digital audio quality is quantified, and how to evaluate signal fidelity. Key topics include the properties of audio waveforms, important digital audio metrics (sample rate, bit depth, etc.), techniques like spectral analysis, and fidelity measures such as frequency response retention, dynamic range accuracy, and signal “coloration” (distortion). We will also discuss any additional considerations (phase, latency, data formats) and how the various data sources (JELLIE, JDAT, Jvid) contribute to training the model.Waveform Physics BasicsIn physics and acoustics, waveforms represent how a signal varies over time. A simple tone is a sine wave, characterized by a single frequency (pitch) and amplitude (loudness). More complex sounds have complex wave shapes, which can be mathematically broken down into multiple sine waves of different frequencies and amplitudes (Fourier components). In fact, any periodic waveform’s shape determines its frequency content (timbre). For example, Fourier analysis shows that a complex waveform (like a square wave or an instrument sound) can be expressed as a sum of sine waves at various harmonically related frequencies ￼. This means the waveform shape and the signal’s spectrum are directly related: sharp corners or rapid changes in a waveform introduce high-frequency components, whereas smooth waveforms contain mostly lower frequencies. Understanding waveform physics is important because the PNBTR model must preserve these waveform characteristics – the phase, frequency, and amplitude content of the original signal – to maintain sound quality.	•	Amplitude and Frequency: The amplitude of a waveform corresponds to sound pressure or signal level (perceived as loudness), while the frequency corresponds to how many oscillations per second (perceived as pitch) ￼. Human hearing ranges roughly from 20 Hz (low bass) to 20 kHz (high treble). Waveforms may also include multiple frequencies simultaneously (harmonics), shaping the sound’s character.	•	Phase: Phase describes the timing alignment of wave components. While phase changes aren’t directly heard as pitch or loudness, they affect waveform shape and can influence how waves interfere. Proper phase alignment between frequencies (or between stereo channels) is crucial for accurate waveform reproduction. A system with linear phase shifts all frequency components by the same time delay, preserving the wave shape and timing ￼. In contrast, non-linear phase response (unequal delay of frequencies) can smear transients or stereo imaging. Thus, the model should ideally apply consistent delays to avoid phase distortion (maintaining time coherence of the signal).Digital Audio Metrics (Sample Rate, Bit Depth, etc.)Digital audio quality is largely determined by two fundamental metrics: sample rate and bit depth ￼. These define how accurately an analog sound waveform is captured in digital form:	•	Sample Rate: This is the number of samples per second used in digitizing audio. According to the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, the sample rate dictates the highest frequency that can be recorded; it must be at least twice the highest frequency of interest ￼. For example, CD audio uses 44.1 kHz, allowing up to ~22 kHz frequencies. In our project, the JELLIE format uses 192 kHz stereo samples, which can capture frequencies up to ~96 kHz (far beyond the normal human hearing range) for maximum fidelity. High sample rates ensure no audible frequency content is lost during capture. However, very high rates also increase data size and can include ultrasonic content that must be handled carefully (ultrasonic frequencies can cause aliasing distortion if downsampled improperly) ￼. We should choose a sample rate that balances capturing all needed detail with practical processing and bandwidth limits. (44.1–48 kHz is usually sufficient for human audio ￼, but 192 kHz provides headroom for research, processing, or if ultrasonics are somehow leveraged in the model.)	•	Bit Depth: This is the number of bits used to represent each audio sample’s amplitude. It determines the resolution or dynamic accuracy of the audio. A higher bit depth provides a lower noise floor and greater dynamic range (the difference between the quietest and loudest sound that can be represented). Each additional bit yields ~6 dB more dynamic range ￼ ￼. For instance, 16-bit audio (used in CDs) offers ~96 dB dynamic range, while 24-bit (common in studio recordings and JELLIE data) offers ~144 dB. Bit depth thus correlates with the precision of amplitude representation – sometimes described as dynamic accuracy ￼. It ensures subtle details in quiet passages or reverb tails aren’t lost in quantization noise. Our model training should take advantage of the 24-bit data in JELLIE to learn from the full dynamic range, and when deploying, ensure that it does not introduce quantization noise or reduce dynamic resolution.	•	Channels: The JELLIE audio data is two-channel (stereo). It’s important to retain channel separation and synchronization. Metrics like channel crosstalk (unwanted bleed between channels) might be considered; the model should preserve stereo imaging. While not a single-number metric, maintaining proper left-right differences (for spatial cues) is a quality consideration.	•	Bit Rate (for compressed data): If any compression is applied (e.g., in JDAT or network transmission), the bit rate (bits per second) becomes a metric impacting quality. Lossy codecs use bit rate to trade off fidelity for size; however, since PNBTR leans on a neural reconfiguration model, it might internally compress data. We should monitor effective bit rates and ensure they are sufficient to retain the above aspects (frequency content, dynamics, etc.) or use lossless methods if possible. Low bit rates can cause audible artifacts or reduced frequency response, so part of our plan is to determine acceptable compression levels if compression is used.Other metrics include signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (closely related to bit depth and quantization noise), total harmonic distortion (THD) (more on this under “Coloration”), and latency. Since PNBTR focuses on low-latency network flow, we aim for minimal delay added by processing or compression. Though our data collection is offline (not real-time), the eventual model should operate in (near) real-time, meaning we must design efficient processing (perhaps processing audio in small chunks or streaming fashion) to meet latency targets (for example, <10–20 ms delay might be a goal for live audio).Spectral Analysis of Audio SignalsTo evaluate and process audio, spectral analysis is essential. This involves examining the audio in the frequency domain rather than just the time domain. Using mathematical tools like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), we can decompose a time-domain signal (waveform) into its constituent frequencies ￼. The result is a spectrum showing the amplitude (and sometimes phase) of each frequency component present in the audio.	•	Frequency Spectrum: By converting a signal to the frequency domain, we get a snapshot of which frequencies are present and at what levels. For example, a complex chord might show distinct peaks at musical note frequencies, and noise would show a broad spread of frequencies. Spectral analysis will let us verify that the PNBTR model preserves the full spectral content of the signal. We can compare the input and output spectra to see if any part of the spectrum is missing or attenuated after processing.	•	Spectrograms: A spectrogram is essentially a sliding spectral analysis over time, showing how the frequency content of a signal evolves. This is useful for analyzing non-steady signals like speech or music where different frequencies come and go. For our neural model, a spectrogram can help visualize if, for instance, high frequencies decay or drop out due to compression at any point, or if artifacts (unintended frequency components) appear. We should use spectral analysis during testing to ensure the model doesn’t introduce odd spikes or roll-offs in certain bands.	•	Use in Training: Spectral features can also be used as part of the training objective. For instance, one could compute a spectral loss (comparing the FFT of output vs input) to encourage the model to maintain the correct frequency balance. We might consider incorporating such frequency-domain considerations so the network learns not just time-domain waveform accuracy but also frequency-domain accuracy.Frequency Response RetentionFrequency response describes how a system treats different frequencies – ideally, an audio system should reproduce all frequencies equally (flat response) within the audible range. In practice, systems have a frequency response curve that shows gain or attenuation across frequencies. Frequency response retention in our context means the neural model should retain the input signal’s frequency content without undue attenuation or boosts across the spectrum.Illustration: An ideal flat frequency response (top) produces an output waveform identical to the input, while a limited frequency response (bottom) attenuates some frequencies and thus alters the output waveform (notice the smoother, less detailed waveform when high frequencies are reduced).When evaluating our model or pipeline, we will drive it with test signals (like sweeps or multi-tone signals) to generate a frequency response plot – essentially measuring output level vs. frequency for a given input. Our goal is a flat line (within reasonable tolerance) indicating all frequencies are passed through equally ￼. Any significant dip or drop-off would mean the model fails to retain those frequencies (for example, a low-pass effect cutting off treble, or a notch attenuating some band).	•	Audible Range Coverage: We must ensure the system covers 20 Hz to 20 kHz robustly (since JELLIE uses 192 kHz sampling, it technically captures up to 96 kHz, but frequencies above 20 kHz are ultrasonic). Even if ultrasonics are not directly audible, if the model is trained on full-band 192 kHz data, it should either reproduce those ultrasonic components or safely ignore them without harming audible content (e.g., by proper filtering to avoid aliasing). Frequency response retention means no unintended roll-off below 20 kHz. For instance, if the network or compression is unintentionally discarding everything above, say, 15 kHz, that would be a problem – we want it to retain up to 20 kHz (and possibly beyond, if we consider future use-cases or data transformations).	•	Flatness and Tolerance: In high-fidelity systems, a frequency response deviation of ±1–3 dB across the range is considered very good (±3 dB is often the threshold of noticeable change in loudness at a given frequency) ￼. We should aim for the model’s output to not deviate by more than a couple dB from the input across the audible spectrum, to ensure transparency. If certain frequencies are consistently off, that indicates the model might be biased or limited (e.g., maybe the neural net had trouble with extreme bass or ultra-high frequencies due to training data bias or architecture). We will need to identify and address that – possibly by augmenting training data or adjusting model capacity for those frequency ranges.	•	Testing Frequency Response: A practical test is to input a sine sweep (tone sweeping through frequencies) or white noise and measure output via an FFT or spectrum analyzer, comparing it to input. This will reveal the frequency response of the entire PNBTR pipeline. We expect a flat response ideally. Any lack of retention (like high-frequency drop-off) needs engineering mitigation (e.g., if due to a sample rate conversion, ensure a better resampler or include that behavior in training so the model compensates).In summary, the PNBTR model should not color the sound by frequency-dependent gain changes. It should preserve the frequency response of the source, meaning all frequencies that come in should come out at comparable levels (unless intentionally modified for some reason, which is not our case here). Maintaining frequency response ties closely with the next topics, dynamic range and coloration, in achieving overall transparent signal reproduction.Dynamic Range and AccuracyDynamic range in audio refers to the span from the quietest to loudest sounds a system can handle (usually given in decibels). Dynamic accuracy means preserving the precise amplitude changes and differences in the audio – essentially faithfully retaining how loud or soft each moment is relative to others. This is largely governed by bit depth in digital audio (as mentioned, higher bit depth = more dynamic range) and by how the system processes volume changes.	•	Preserving Dynamics: Our model should keep the micro-dynamics (small fluctuations in volume, transients) and macro-dynamics (overall loudness differences between sections) intact. For example, if the input audio has a very quiet passage followed by a loud crescendo, the output should reflect the same contrast. Any unintended compression (reducing the difference) or expansion (increasing difference) would be an accuracy issue. Since JDAT might include user-modified data, we should ensure any dynamic range modifications are either intentional by the user or accounted for, and not a side effect of the model.	•	Bit Depth and Noise Floor: With 24-bit source data, the theoretical dynamic range is ~144 dB ￼, far exceeding what any listening environment can accommodate (and human ears can typically handle around 120 dB from threshold to pain). In practice, microphone self-noise or environment noise usually set the noise floor, but it’s still important that our pipeline does not significantly raise the noise floor. Quantization noise should be negligible; if we ever reduce bit depth (e.g., to 16-bit for output), using dither can help preserve low-level detail without introducing tonal artifacts. “Dynamic accuracy” also implies resolution – the ability to represent small amplitude changes. A 16-bit system has a resolution of ~±1 part in 65,536 of full scale. 24-bit extends that to 1 in ~16.7 million. Our model, during training and inference, likely works with floating point, so internal precision is high; we just need to ensure that when converting back to fixed-point or transmitting, we don’t lose too much resolution.	•	Transient Response: Quick, loud transients (like drum hits or plosives in speech) test a system’s dynamic accuracy. The model must not smear or clip transients. Clipping (from overload) would be a gross error – to avoid this, ensure the model’s outputs are properly normalized or that training includes occasional high-level signals so it learns to handle them without saturating. If any dynamic range compression is implicitly happening (some neural nets might average out or damp rapid changes if not trained well), we should detect that by comparing envelopes of input vs output. The goal is that a spike of sound remains a spike of the same relative magnitude.In short, dynamic accuracy means the loudness contour of the audio is preserved. From the softest details (which should remain audible above the noise floor) to the loudest peaks (which should not be attenuated or clipped), the relationship is the same as the source. Given that digital audio quality is indeed often summarized by “captured frequencies (sample rate) and dynamic accuracy (bit depth)” ￼, our training must ensure both dimensions are respected. Techniques like level calibration, dynamic range tests (using calibrated tones at different levels), and noise floor measurements on the output will help verify this.Distortion and “Color” in Audio SignalsIn audio terminology, “coloration” or “color” refers to any deviation a system introduces that makes the output sound different from the input, aside from simple frequency response or level changes. Often, this comes in the form of harmonic distortion, nonlinearities, or added noise. The user’s mention of “color %” likely points to quantifying added coloration/distortion as a percentage – this is essentially what Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) measures. THD is defined as the ratio of the power of all harmonic frequencies introduced by the system to the power of the fundamental frequency, expressed as a percentage ￼. It’s a common metric for amplifiers and audio gear to indicate how “clean” the signal is.	•	Transparency vs. Coloration: For our PNBTR neural model, the goal is likely transparency – we want the output to sound the same as the input (unless a creative effect is desired, but here it’s about data fidelity). Thus, we aim to minimize any “color” the model adds. In practical terms, we want extremely low distortion. High-quality audio electronics often have THD well below 0.1%. In professional settings, <0.1% THD is a standard target for transparency ￼, and hi-fi equipment often boasts <0.01% THD ￼ (virtually inaudible levels of distortion). Our model should strive for similarly negligible distortion.	•	Harmonic Distortion & Noise: Distortion can introduce new frequency components (e.g., harmonic overtones not present in the original, caused by nonlinear clipping or transfer functions). It can also manifest as intermodulation distortion (new tones from interaction of frequencies). We will measure the output for any spurious tones or increased harmonic content. For example, feeding a pure sine wave to the model and examining the output spectrum should ideally show only that frequency. If we see small harmonic spikes (2nd harmonic, 3rd harmonic, etc.), we can quantify the THD%. We should also measure THD+N (total harmonic distortion plus noise) which includes added broadband noise. If the model is introducing hiss or other noise, that increases this metric. Ensuring a high bit depth and proper training (with perhaps a loss term that penalizes deviation from the clean signal) can help keep distortion low.	•	Coloration as “flavor”: It’s worth noting that in audio production, some coloration is intentionally added by things like tube amplifiers or tape machines which add euphonic distortion. However, in our use-case (data reconfiguration), we do not want unintended color. As one audio expert explains, “’Color’ [in audio gear] is a reference to distortion… signals passed through not sounding exactly like the original ￼.” All systems impart some color, but our aim is to push any such difference below the threshold of audibility. Typically, distortion under 0.1% at normal listening levels is very hard to detect ￼. If our model’s processing remains in that ballpark or better, we’re good. We should verify this by perceptual testing and objective metrics.	•	Metric for Color %: If the user interface or internal logs present a “color %”, it might correspond to THD percentage or some similar measure of how much the signal has been altered. We will incorporate a pipeline to calculate this: e.g., play a test tone or a multi-tone signal, record the output, and compute distortion. Alternatively, “color %” could be an aggregate measure of frequency response deviation + distortion. In any case, we’ll ensure to minimize it. For training, possibly adding a regularization for linearity could be beneficial (e.g., encouraging the model to behave linearly for given ranges).	•	Avoiding Clipping and Nonlinearities: One obvious source of distortion is clipping (if the signal level exceeds the maximum representable range). We must prevent that by proper gain staging. The training data should be normalized or at least within a safe range. If the model has any kind of activation functions that could saturate, we have to account for that (for example, using linear outputs or applying techniques to handle headroom). Any learned internal compression should be monitored.In summary, “color” = distortion/alteration. We plan to measure it (via THD or similar) and keep it very low. The PNBTR system should be largely transparent: the output should not only have the same frequency content and dynamics as input, but also lack any additional unwanted harmonics or noise. This ensures that the model’s reconfiguration doesn’t degrade audio quality. As a reference, maintaining THD under 0.1% (and ideally closer to 0.01% for critical listening) is a good target ￼.Additional ConsiderationsBeyond the primary metrics above, there are other factors and best practices to ensure the success of PNBTR learning and deployment:	•	Phase Linearity: As mentioned, preserving phase relationships is important. Non-linear phase can cause subtle time-domain distortions (e.g., pre-echo or ringing artifacts around transients). We prefer linear phase handling so that the waveform shape (especially of complex signals) stays intact ￼. In training, if we use any filtering or convolution, linear-phase filters (or incorporating an all-pass to correct phase) might be considered. This is especially vital if the system will handle stereo or surround signals – phase differences between channels are crucial for spatial imaging.	•	Latency and Real-Time Processing: The model will operate over a network in low-latency mode, meaning it needs to process data in small chunks quickly. We should structure the model (and its learning) to work frame-by-frame or with streaming capability. This might involve using causal convolutions or recurrent architectures that can handle a continuous stream, or dividing input into short frames (e.g., 20 ms audio frames) that the model processes sequentially. We must balance latency with quality – smaller frames yield lower delay but might limit frequency resolution if using spectral methods (time-frequency uncertainty tradeoff). The plan should evaluate what frame size (or algorithmic delay) is acceptable. For instance, a 5–10 ms algorithmic delay might be low enough for interactive use (like live audio). The training data (JELLIE, JDAT) can be segmented accordingly so the model learns on short sequences and can generalize to streaming input.	•	Jitter and Network Issues: In a network flow, jitter (variations in packet timing) can occur. While not directly an audio metric, our system might need to handle buffer underruns or overruns smoothly. Designing the model robustly (maybe with some buffering or adaptive sync) will prevent audible dropouts. Training won’t directly cover network jitter, but testing should simulate network conditions to ensure resilience.	•	Data Volume and Compression: With 2 channels at 192 kHz, 24-bit, the raw data rate is very high (~9.2 Mbit/s per channel, ~18.4 Mbit/s stereo). This is likely why a neural reconfiguration (possibly a kind of neural compression or format) is desired – to reduce bandwidth while keeping quality. Our plan should consider compression efficiency: what kind of bitrate reduction can we achieve without perceptible loss? Traditional codecs achieve huge reductions by exploiting human perception limits (cutting inaudible parts). A neural model could learn an efficient coding scheme. We should measure success by metrics like PESQ or PEAQ (perceptual audio quality scores) and by how much data is saved. Also, ensure that the model doesn’t output something drastically bigger than input (that would defeat purpose). If JDAT is a “less reliable but usable” data format, perhaps it’s a more compressed version – the model might learn to upscale or enhance JDAT data towards JELLIE quality.	•	Multimodal (Audio/Video) Handling: The inclusion of Jvid (video data treated like an audio stream) means the model might be one that handles generic streams of numbers representing either sound or images. Video frames could be serialized (e.g., line by line pixel data or compressed in some way to mimic a waveform). Additional metrics for video would include resolution, frame rate, and color fidelity. Treating video like audio means we might be sending video frames as sequences of samples. The model needs to preserve spatial details (which in serial form translate to certain high-frequency patterns in the 1D stream). In evaluation, we would use metrics like PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) or SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) for video reconstruction quality, and ensure that color information is not distorted (e.g., no excessive color banding or hue shifts – in image terms, analogous to frequency response and distortion in audio). The concept of color % could apply here too, as video color accuracy can be measured (like percentage coverage of color gamut or delta-E in color reproduction). We should include some video-specific tests when training on Jvid data – e.g., feed known patterns through and see if they come out intact.	•	Robustness and Generalization: The data sources might vary – JELLIE is likely pristine, JDAT might include various user recordings of different quality (maybe lower sample rates, noisy environments, or user-supplied modifications). The model should generalize across these. It may need to learn to recognize and handle noise or artifacts (maybe JDAT has more noise) – possibly even treat them as augmentations. We should incorporate noise training (so the model doesn’t mistake noise for signal or vice versa) and ensure it doesn’t overfit to only extremely clean data. If JDAT is “less reliable,” perhaps that means we label or weight those samples appropriately during training (so the model learns from them but also knows how to correct or not be thrown off by their imperfections).	•	Validation Metrics: During development, we will use objective metrics to validate the model’s performance: frequency response deviation (in dB), THD%, noise floor (dBFS), perhaps perceptual metrics (like a MUSHRA listening test if possible, or using known audio quality assessment models). For video, metrics like PSNR or VMAF (Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion) could be used for any Jvid reconstructions. The reward system mentioned (JAMBucks for contributing data) implies user test data – once we have a model, we could also validate on real user-submitted samples and measure how well it reconstructs or transmits those.Data Collection Formats and Training Integration (JELLIE, JDAT, Jvid)The PNBTR learning will be fueled by several types of datasets, as described:	•	JELLIE: This appears to be the highest quality audio data – “2×192 kHz samples” suggests stereo 192 kHz PCM. Likely 24-bit or 32-bit float. JELLIE recordings might be lab-quality or reference recordings. These will serve as ground truth training targets or high-fidelity examples. For training, if we are developing a compression model, we might feed the original audio (JELLIE) and train the network to encode/decode it with minimal loss. JELLIE ensures the model sees what “perfect” audio looks like across frequency and dynamic range.	•	JDAT: Described as “less reliable but still usable data,” this might be user-recorded audio or a compressed version of JELLIE. It could be that JDAT is a deteriorated or lower-quality dataset (maybe phone recordings, or data with packet loss, etc.). It’s still usable, so we include it to broaden the training distribution. The model might learn to denoise or correct some of the issues if we pair JDAT examples with JELLIE references, or at least not to exacerbate problems. JDAT could also represent the normal operating data format over the network, which is why it’s important to train on it – the model should learn to do the best with slightly compromised input as well. We will ensure JDAT conforms to formatting standards (so maybe things like sample rate or chunk size are consistent) when feeding it in.	•	User Mods/Applications of JDAT: This suggests that third parties or users might generate data based on JDAT format, possibly creative modifications or different source material that still follows the same data structure. This expands the diversity of training data. We’ll incorporate any user-provided datasets that meet the format, which might include various content types (music, speech, environmental sounds, etc.). A diverse training set helps the model generalize and not be tuned only to specific audio content. We should be cautious that user-provided data might have wild variations (some might even intentionally distort audio in ways that confuse the model). A strategy is to validate and maybe filter such data (the prompt mentions “once validated as usable test data”) – so likely, we’ll have a validation step to ensure the data is labeled or formatted correctly and is within expected ranges before using it in training.	•	Jvid: This is video data that is mapped and chunked like audio. Possibly, video frames (or compressed video streams) are represented in a vector form and split into chunks (like audio samples in time). The model will thus see Jvid as another sequence of numbers. We might either train a single unified model that doesn’t care if the input represents audio or video (treating both as generic signals), or have the model condition on the type of data. If truly unified, the model might just learn the statistical structures of both modalities. Video signals have different patterns (e.g., higher correlation between adjacent samples if those samples correspond to neighboring pixels), but a powerful sequence model (like a Transformer or large CNN) could potentially handle it. We need to ensure that including Jvid doesn’t compromise audio performance (and vice versa) – one way might be to alternate training or use multi-task learning objectives.During training, we will feed in all these data forms. Possibly, we simulate the network transmission by adding constraints or artificial packetization. The phrase “one Neural data signal reconfiguration model” suggests a single model is meant to handle all these input types and output reconfigured (presumably reconstructed or improved) signals on the other end. The training objective will likely be to minimize the difference between the model’s output and the original high-quality input (for cases where the model is effectively doing compression/decompression or enhancement). For example, if JDAT is a lossy version of JELLIE, we train the model to take JDAT (or its encoded form) and output something matching JELLIE. For Jvid, similarly, output a video that matches the original input frames.We will carefully design the formatting and chunking during training to mirror real operation. If video is chunked in certain frame-sized pieces, the model should train on those to learn the continuity. If audio is split into segments, ensure the model can handle segment boundaries (maybe with overlap-add or context windows to avoid boundary artifacts).Finally, once the model is trained, we will validate it with a variety of test inputs covering all edge cases: very high frequencies, very low frequencies, rapid transients, complex music, speech, silent passages, etc., as well as high-motion video vs static video, detailed textures vs smooth gradients in video, etc. The evaluation criteria will loop back to all the metrics discussed:	•	Does the waveform look identical or very close to original (when aligning output to input)?	•	Is the frequency spectrum of output matching the input’s (flat frequency response retention)?	•	Is the dynamic range preserved (no inadvertent compression or expansion, noise floor acceptable)?	•	Is added distortion (coloration) minimal (THD within targets, no visible artifacting in waveform or spectrogram)?	•	Is the latency within requirements and the model stable for streaming?	•	For video, are frames reconstructed clearly (no blocking, no significant blurring beyond acceptable compression, and color accuracy is maintained)?By addressing all of the above, we plan to thoroughly “do our homework” on PNBTR learning – covering the physics and metrics that define digital audio/video quality and ensuring our neural model is trained to respect them. This comprehensive approach will help the PNBTR system achieve its goal of reconfiguring signals over a network with high fidelity and low latency, ultimately rewarding users (with JAMBucks and, more importantly, with great audio/visual quality) for their contributions to the training data.Sources:	1.

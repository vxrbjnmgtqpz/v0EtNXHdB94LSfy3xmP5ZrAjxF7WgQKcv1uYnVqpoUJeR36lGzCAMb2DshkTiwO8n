## 📦 BACKED UP CONTENT

### TOASTer Application State
- **Build Status:** ✅ Fully functional JUCE app that builds and launches
- **App Bundle:** `TOASTer.app` successfully generated
- **CMake Config:** Proper JUCE 8.0.4 integration with all required modules

### Source Code Files Backed Up

### Documentation Backed Up
- TRANSPORT_HELP_REQUEST.md (comprehensive analysis of transport issues)
- BUILD_HELP_RESPONSE.md (technical build guidance)
- TOASTER_ADAPTATION_COMPLETE.md (progress summary)
- All legacy CMakeLists variants preserved

## 🔧 TECHNICAL STATE

### What's Working
- ✅ JUCE 8.0.4 CMake integration
- ✅ App compilation and linking
- ✅ macOS app bundle generation
- ✅ Professional transport controller class implementation
- ✅ MIDI panel with working device discovery
- ✅ Fixed all compilation errors

### Current Issues Identified
- ❌ Transport display format not showing microsecond precision
- ❌ App may be showing basic transport instead of professional controller
- ❌ Need to verify correct component instantiation

## 🎯 NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASE

The backup preserves all working code while the transport controller format is being resolved. The TRANSPORT_HELP_REQUEST.md document contains comprehensive analysis for the next development phase.

### Priority Tasks
1. Fix transport controller microsecond display format (00:00:00.000000)
2. Verify ProfessionalTransportController is being used (not BasicTransportPanel)
3. Add remaining panels incrementally after transport is perfected

## 📋 REPOSITORY STATUS

**Files Changed:** 82 files updated/added  
**Compression:** 3.05 MiB total changes  
**Status:** All changes successfully pushed to GitHub  
**Backup Integrity:** ✅ Complete

This backup ensures all TOASTer development progress is preserved on GitHub while transport controller issues are resolved.

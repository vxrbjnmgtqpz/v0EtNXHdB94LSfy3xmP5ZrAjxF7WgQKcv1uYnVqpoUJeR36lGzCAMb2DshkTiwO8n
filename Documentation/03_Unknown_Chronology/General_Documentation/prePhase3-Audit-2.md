Diagnostic Summary of MIDIp2p Documentation vs. Current Project Reality

JMID Framework (JSON MIDI) Documentation

Claims: The JMID README describes a JSON-based MIDI event protocol (compact “JMID” format) for transmitting MIDI messages. It likely explains the basic JSON structure for MIDI events and notes that the core MIDI functionality is implemented and working. In the current docs, JMID is presented as functional (the baseline v0.8 had JMID “core functionality validated” ￼) and possibly implies a standard reliable transport. The README may not yet mention any special reliability mechanism beyond normal packet delivery.

Gaps vs. Reality: This documentation is incomplete relative to the new scope. It does not reflect the “burst-deduplication” reliability scheme now central to JMID’s design. The project’s roadmap introduces redundant burst transmission (sending 3–5 duplicate packets per MIDI event) and deduplication on receive to achieve 66% packet loss tolerance without retries ￼. If the JMID README hasn’t been updated, it likely omits these fire-and-forget UDP burst mechanics. It may still assume a reliable or ordered channel, whereas the current design emphasizes stateless, unordered UDP delivery with GPU-accelerated deduplication of bursts ￼. Additionally, JMID’s docs might not highlight that parsing is intended to be offloaded to the GPU. In reality, JMID is now “ready for GPU processing” according to the roadmap ￼. The README should be updated to note that JMID parsing leverages GPU parallelism and memory-mapped data, rather than just CPU, to drastically reduce MIDI handling latency. Without these updates, the JMID documentation does not accurately convey the framework’s current architecture or its role in the GPU/UDP model.

JDAT Framework (JSON-ADAT Audio) Documentation

Claims: The JDAT README likely introduces “JSON as ADAT” – a scheme to send multichannel audio data in JSON lines akin to the ADAT optical audio format. It probably describes the JSON audio packet structure (headers, channels, etc.) and might state that basic framing is in place (the baseline had JDAT’s header format “established” ￼). The documentation might focus on how audio samples are represented in JSON, possibly acknowledging the high data rates but without concrete solutions.

Gaps vs. Reality: The JDAT docs are outdated/incomplete given the current scope. At baseline, JDAT was only partially implemented (header defined, but real-time streaming was theoretical) ￼ ￼. Now the project has pivoted to a GPU-accelerated, memory-mapped approach for audio. The roadmap specifies that JDAT is optimized for parallel processing and uses memory mapping for GPU sharing ￼. Unless updated, the README likely doesn’t mention the new GPU memory-mapped buffer architecture that allows audio JSONL streams to feed directly into GPU memory. It may also not discuss how JDAT integrates with the UDP transport (TOAST) to send audio with minimal overhead. In reality, JDAT will rely on the UDP-based TOAST tunnel and GPU compute shaders for PCM data processing (e.g. a pcm_repair.glsl for audio sample ops ￼). If the documentation hasn’t been revised, it might still describe JDAT in abstract or CPU-bound terms, and fail to mention the critical shift to GPU parsing/processing and parallel JSONL handling. This would leave readers unaware of the major performance architecture now planned for JDAT.

JVID Framework (JSON Video) Documentation

Claims: The JVID README presumably outlines an experimental framework for real-time video streaming in JSON. It likely states that video frames are serialized (possibly as Base64 images or pixel data) into JSON lines for transport. Given the early state of the project, the JVID documentation might be sparse or conceptual, describing intended features (e.g. sending raw pixel data or using JSON to encapsulate video frames) without full implementation details. It probably does not have much on performance, focusing instead on the idea of combining video with the audio/MIDI streams.

Gaps vs. Reality: JVID’s documentation is incomplete and outdated relative to the current plan. Originally, video data in JSON would have been very bandwidth-heavy (perhaps using Base64 encoding). The new design explicitly plans “direct pixel” JSONL transmission with no Base64 overhead ￼. If the README hasn’t been updated, it likely doesn’t mention this crucial optimization. Instead, it might still assume a placeholder method or not discuss how frames are handled. Additionally, the docs likely omit that JVID will utilize the GPU for encoding/decoding: the roadmap intends for JVID to be parsed by GPU (with a JVIDDirectPixel decoder in the JAM parser) ￼. The documentation might not reflect that video frames are processed on the GPU alongside audio for unified timing. Lastly, any previous cross-platform notes in JVID’s docs (e.g. using OpenGL or platform-specific video) should be revisited, since now the focus is on Vulkan/Metal via the unified GPU pipeline. In summary, the JVID README needs updates to describe the zero-copy, GPU-based pixel streaming approach instead of any older, less efficient methods.

PNBTR Framework (Predictive Neural Buffered Transient Recovery) Documentation

Claims: The PNBTR README likely introduces PNBTR as a novel approach to audio continuity – essentially a smarter alternative to dithering that predictively fills in lost or low bits. It probably defines PNBTR’s purpose as “dither replacement” (as noted in the main overview) to improve audio quality during dropouts or at low bit depths. However, given PNBTR is a complex, future-phase component, the existing documentation may be minimal – perhaps just a conceptual description – without details of implementation. It might describe PNBTR in broad strokes (e.g. using prediction to recover transients) and note that it’s planned for a later phase.

Gaps vs. Reality: The current PNBTR documentation is very likely outdated by omission, as the project scope has significantly expanded this concept. The roadmap now details an entire GPU-native neural network system for PNBTR, including multiple GLSL shader modules and machine-learning inference components ￼ ￼. Unless the README was updated recently, it probably doesn’t mention:
	•	that PNBTR will run on the GPU using compute shaders and ML models ￼,
	•	the specific techniques like LPC modeling, pitch-cycle reconstruction, and RNN/CNN modules the team is implementing ￼, or
	•	the new philosophy of “zero-noise” 24-bit audio with musically intelligent reconstruction ￼.
If the PNBTR doc still frames it as a general idea, it misses that PNBTR is central to the “musical continuity” in JAMNet, working in real-time to predict and replace lost audio data on the fly. In reality, PNBTR is a cornerstone of the JAMNet system’s ability to maintain audio quality under UDP packet loss, so the docs should emphasize its predictive ML-based approach and integration with JDAT (audio streaming). Currently, readers of the old README would not realize the depth of neural processing (and GPU reliance) that PNBTR entails in the latest roadmap.

TOAST Protocol (Transport Layer) Documentation

Claims: The TOAST README describes the “Transport Oriented Audio Sync Tunnel,” which was the custom transport protocol developed for the system. Initially, TOAST was likely built atop TCP or websockets (given the original system used Bassoon.js and had TCP in place ￼). The documentation probably covers the basic frame format and goals of TOAST: synchronizing audio/MIDI streams with low latency, possibly using timestamps for alignment. It might claim features like timing coordination between sender and receiver, and describe how TOAST packaged MIDI and audio data into frames. If written early on, it may have emphasized reliable delivery or used TCP’s reliability, and possibly mentioned future UDP plans only in passing.

Gaps vs. Reality: The TOAST protocol docs are now outdated because the transport design has fundamentally changed. The project has shifted to “UDP-first”, stateless messaging with a new frame structure (TOAST v2) and no reliance on TCP. The roadmap calls this a “critical architecture pivot from TCP to UDP” ￼. The TOAST README likely does not reflect the fire-and-forget UDP multicast model now adopted – i.e., no handshakes, no ACKs, no built-in retransmission ￼. It probably also lacks details on the lightweight UDP framing that has been designed specifically for JSONL streams ￼. For example, TOAST v2 frames include stream type, format (JSON/compact/binary), sequence numbers, etc. ￼, but the original documentation might not mention any of this if it predates the UDP redesign. Moreover, the concept of stateless, self-contained messages (each carrying its own timestamp and session ID) is a key principle now ￼ ￼, ensuring that no connection state is required. Any prior documentation that implied a session state (or relied on TCP’s ordering) is now incorrect. In short, the TOAST transport write-up needs updating to describe TOASTv2’s UDP multicast frame format and stateless operation, and to drop any assumptions of TCP-based reliability or ordering. Without these updates, the documentation misrepresents how data is actually moving through JAMNet today.

TOASTer Application (Client App) Documentation

Claims: The TOASTer README likely portrays the application as a working demo/client for the TOAST protocol. It probably describes TOASTer’s features – e.g. a GUI that allows users to send/receive audio and MIDI streams over the network using the JAMNet protocols. It may include instructions to run the app, connect to peers, and perhaps a screenshot or GUI overview. Essentially, it would claim that TOASTer is the testbed for the streaming technology. Given the baseline state, the README might implicitly assume everything is functional on the current tech stack (which at that time was using TCP under the hood). It might not mention any limitations, presenting TOASTer as an operational tool for low-latency jamming.

Gaps vs. Reality: In reality, TOASTer is currently non-functional (or severely limited) in the context of the new architecture. The documentation does not reflect this broken state. As of the latest roadmap, TOASTer runs, but only on the old networking model – it “builds and runs successfully” but is “currently running TCP” ￼. The entire system is awaiting the Phase 3 refactor (the JAM Framework fork with UDP/GPU support) to truly bring TOASTer up to date. The README, however, likely hasn’t been updated to warn users that at this moment TOASTer does not perform as intended under the new UDP paradigm. For example, if the README promises real-time streaming between peers, that’s misleading – the app hasn’t yet integrated the UDP multicast engine or the GPU acceleration. It’s effectively on hold until the core library (JAM Framework) is rewritten in Phase 3. There is also a Phase 3 intent to incorporate GPU processing into TOASTer via the new JAM.js core ￼, which the current README probably doesn’t mention. In summary, the TOASTer doc should explicitly note that the app is in transition: it remains a prototype awaiting the upcoming UDP/GPU overhaul and currently uses legacy methods. As it stands, the documentation does not acknowledge the app’s temporary broken/incomplete status, which could mislead users or contributors about TOASTer’s capabilities at this stage.

JAMNet-Wide Documentation & Roadmap

Main README Claims: The top-level README (and/or project overview in the Roadmap) gives a high-level picture of the MIDIp2p project, now dubbed JAMNet. It correctly identifies the major components (JMID, JDAT, JVID, TOAST/TOASTer, PNBTR) and emphasizes a “real-time audio/MIDI streaming platform built on GPU-accelerated JSON protocols with UDP-native streaming.”. This is largely aligned with the current vision. It lists all open-source frameworks and even notes GPU and memory-mapped aspects in their one-line descriptions – for example, JDAT is described with “GPU/memory mapped processing” and JMID with “GPU parsing”. The main README also mentions the proprietary apps and states that all systems use GPU-accelerated compute shaders and UDP-based TOAST. So the overarching documentation does attempt to capture the revolutionary architecture.

Needed Updates (Project-Wide): Despite the improvements, some key points are missing or could be clearer in the JAMNet-wide docs. Specifically, the documentation should be updated to fully reflect:
	•	GPU/Memory-Mapped JSONL Parsing: It should highlight that JSON Lines for MIDI, audio, etc., are processed in parallel on the GPU via memory-mapped buffers (zero-copy from network to GPU) ￼ ￼. Currently, a reader might not grasp how integral the GPU is for parsing; a dedicated explanation of the GPU JSONL parser and memory mapping would help (the roadmap’s Phase 2/3 covers this in detail ￼ ￼).
	•	UDP “Fire-and-Forget” Design: The core docs should stress that the system has abandoned TCP reliability in favor of a stateless, fire-and-forget UDP multicast approach ￼. This means no handshakes, no acknowledgments, and sending data without waiting – a radical departure from typical streaming. The benefits (ultra-low latency, infinite receiver scalability) and trade-offs (packet loss handled by redundancy, not retries) should be clearly stated, aligning with the roadmap’s outline of UDP-first transport ￼.
	•	Burst-Deduplicated MIDI (JMID): The main documentation should incorporate the concept of burst transmission for MIDI events – i.e. sending multiple copies of each MIDI message in a microtime burst and deduplicating them on the GPU. This novel reliability technique is currently only detailed deep in the roadmap ￼. Summarizing it in the README will inform users how JAMNet achieves reliability over UDP for MIDI without introducing latency.
	•	Predictive Audio Reconstruction (PNBTR): While PNBTR is mentioned as a dither replacement, the README could better convey its significance. It should explain that PNBTR uses machine learning on the GPU to predict and fill in lost audio samples for smooth audio even under packet loss ￼. Emphasizing the “neural buffered transient recovery” aspect – essentially that the system doesn’t just send audio, it intelligently heals audio gaps in real-time – would align the docs with the project’s cutting-edge claims.
	•	Intentional Omission of Native Windows Support: The platform strategy needs to be made explicit. Currently, the roadmap spells out that Windows users will be supported via a Linux VM with JAMNet pre-configured ￼, not a native Windows build. The general README should clearly reflect this decision. Any previous implication that a Windows version is coming natively is outdated. Stating the plan — Mac and Linux are supported natively (Metal/Vulkan), while Windows will run through a specialized Linux VM for stability and performance — will manage expectations and explain the rationale (avoiding driver issues, etc. ￼). This is a conscious strategic choice, and the documentation should openly note it to avoid confusion for Windows users.

In summary, the main project documentation and roadmap are mostly aligned with the current ambitious scope, but they need some corrections and additions to be fully accurate. Ensuring that the documentation highlights the GPU-accelerated, UDP-native architecture in all components, acknowledges the current limitations (like TOASTer’s status), and updates any legacy references will bring it in line with the project’s reality as described in the roadmap. This diagnostic review shows that while the blueprints for JAMNet’s “GPU+UDP revolution” are in place in the roadmap, the various README files must catch up by correcting outdated info and elaborating on the new innovations so that contributors and users have an accurate understanding of the system’s functionality and architecture ￼ ￼.

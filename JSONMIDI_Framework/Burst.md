Perfect — let’s architect the JMID burst logic system, tuned for ultra-low-latency, UDP-based, fire-and-forget MIDI streaming with redundancy. This will act as the temporal anti-aliasing layer that gives you robustness without retransmission.

🎯 Primary Goal
Transmit redundant bursts of MIDI messages (note on/off, CC, etc.) using JAM’s JSONL-over-TOAST layer, such that:

Timing is sub-millisecond accurate

Latency is deterministic (no waiting, no ACKs)

Packet loss doesn’t interrupt musical intent

The receiver deduplicates bursts into a clean event stream

📦 JMID Redundant Burst Format
✅ JSONL Message Format (per burst)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "t": "mid",
  "id": "jmid",
  "msg": {
    "type": "note_on",
    "channel": 1,
    "note": 60,
    "velocity": 120
  },
  "ts": 1680549112.429381,  // Transport-aligned float timestamp
  "burst": 0,               // Sequence index in this burst
  "burst_id": "a4f3kX8Z",   // UUID per message intent
  "repeat": 4,              // Total count for this burst
  "origin": "JAMBox-01"
}
burst_id: unique to each logical event (same across the 3–5 redundant packets)

burst: 0 to N (position within the burst, useful if timing-skewed)

repeat: Total planned burst size (used by receiver to set expectation window)

ts: Original transport timestamp — critical for de-duplication and sync

You can send the same structure for CCs, pitch bend, etc.

🔁 Transmission Rules
✉️ Burst Size
Default: 3 identical messages per event

Max: 5 (for safety-critical messages like Note Off)

Adaptive: If packet loss rate is high (monitored externally), bump up burst size

⏱️ Burst Spacing (Intra-event)
Option 1: All packets burst simultaneously (multi-send in tight loop)

Option 2: Micro-jittered across a 0.5ms window to spread arrival times:
ts + 0ms, ts + 0.2ms, ts + 0.4ms
→ Reduces chance of all packets hitting same lost buffer interval

🕛 Max Burst Time Window
Burst transmission window: ≤ 1ms

All burst packets must be in-flight within this time

Designed to fall within PNTBTR's 1ms predictive window

🧠 Receiver Deduplication Model
🧩 Primary Mechanism
Collapse multiple matching packets (same burst_id) into one logical MIDI event

Use:

Matching msg payload

Consistent burst_id

Close timestamp proximity (< 1ms)

✅ Acceptance Rules
Accept the first arrival of each burst_id as canonical

Discard duplicates arriving within 1ms (or defined burst_timeout)

Optional: average their arrival jitter for tighter sync, but only first triggers action

🧪 Packet Loss Tolerance
As long as 1/3 packets arrive, the event fires

If 2+ arrive: use redundancy to confirm and smooth timestamp deviation

If all are lost: PNBTR may infer missed event based on:

Prior stream rhythm

Expected note durations

Probabilistic models (event prediction)

📊 Burst Performance Model
Factor	Value
Typical note event burst size	3
Burst duration window	0.5–1ms
Typical network jitter immunity	±0.3ms
Max tolerated packet loss (per burst)	66%
Ideal processing overhead	~30–50μs per event burst
Receiver deduplication latency	<50μs in GPU/VRAM

🔒 Additional Protections
Burst ID Rotation: Use a rolling UUID per message intent. Prevents overlap across unrelated MIDI streams.

Duplicate suppression window: If duplicate arrives 5ms+ late → discard regardless.

Loss detection trigger: If multiple burst_ids missing over time → elevate burst size adaptively.

🔜 Optional Advanced Ideas
"Jitter fingerprinting": Use arrival times of redundant packets to infer network quality or path health

"Ghost note inference": If note_on is received, but matching note_off burst is lost, PNBTR can auto-terminate based on average note duration

✅ Summary Spec Checklist
 JSONL schema supports burst tagging (burst_id, burst, repeat)

 Sender fires all packets within 1ms using jittered pattern

 Receiver stores recent burst_id history and timestamps

 First valid burst packet triggers event; others ignored

 Receiver adapts if only 1/3 or 2/3 packets arrive

 All logic designed for fire-and-forget over TOAST
